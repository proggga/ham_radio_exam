# Rules and Regulations

## 1. Definition of Amateur Service
Defined in ITU Radio Regulations (Article 1.56):
> "A radiocommunication service for the purpose of self-training, intercommunication and technical investigations carried out by amateurs, that is, by duly authorized persons interested in radio technique solely with a personal aim and **without pecuniary interest**."

*   **Key points:** Self-training, Technical investigation, Non-commercial (No money).

## 2. Laws and Decrees
*   **Telecommunicatiewet:** The primary Dutch law governing telecommunications.
*   **Frequentiebesluit 2013:** Regulates frequency use.
*   **Regeling gebruik van frequentieruimte:** Specific rules for amateurs.

## 3. Station Status
*   **Primary (Primair):** Protected service. Can claim protection from harmful interference.
*   **Secondary (Secundair):**
    1.  Must not cause harmful interference to Primary stations.
    2.  Cannot claim protection from harmful interference from Primary stations.
    3.  Can claim protection from other Secondary stations (first come, first served).

## 4. Classes of Emission
ITU codes used to describe signals (e.g., J3E, A1A). See [Modulation](../01_electricity/11_modulation.md).
*   **1st Symbol:** Type of Modulation.
    *   **A:** Amplitude (Double Sideband).
    *   **J:** SSB (Suppressed Carrier).
    *   **F:** Frequency Modulation.
    *   **G:** Phase Modulation.
*   **2nd Symbol:** Nature of Signal.
    *   **1:** Single channel, digital (no subcarrier) - e.g., CW.
    *   **2:** Single channel, digital (with subcarrier).
    *   **3:** Single channel, analogue.
*   **3rd Symbol:** Type of Information.
    *   **A:** Aural Telegraphy (Morse by ear).
    *   **B:** Electronic Telegraphy (RTTY/Digimodes).
    *   **E:** Telephony (Voice).
    *   **F:** Video (TV).

### Common Examples
| Code | Common Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A1A** | CW | Morse code (Amplitude keyed, no modulation). |
| **A3E** | AM | Amplitude Modulation Telephony. |
| **J3E** | SSB | Single Sideband Telephony (Suppressed carrier). |
| **F3E** | FM | Frequency Modulation Telephony. |
| **F1B** | RTTY/FSK | Digital Telegraphy (Frequency Shift Keying). |
| **F2D** | Packet | Data transmission via FM subcarrier. |
