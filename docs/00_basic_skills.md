Radio engineering is applied physics. This map covers the fundamental mathematical tools and physical concepts required for the exam.

## Fundamental Units & Math
*   **SI Units & Prefixes** - The language of measurement (Volts, Amps, Hz).
*   **Mathematical Concepts for Radio** - Scientific notation, formulas, and percentages.
*   **Graphs and Data** - Understanding linear vs. logarithmic scales.

## Radio Math
*   **Decibels & Logarithms** - Calculating gain and signal strength ratios.
*   **Geometry & Trigonometry** - Essential for AC theory (Pythagoras, Sine/Cosine).
*   **Number Systems** - Binary and Hexadecimal for digital modes.

## Physics
*   **Physics Principles** - Conservation of energy and efficiency.
