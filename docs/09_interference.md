# Eindterm 9: Interference and Immunity (Storing en immuniteit)

- **EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility):**
  - **Emission:** Equipment should not generate excessive noise.
  - **Immunity:** Equipment should function correctly in the presence of noise.
- **Types of Interference:**
  - **Harmonics:** Integer multiples of fundamental.
  - **Spurious Emissions:** Non-harmonic unwanted emissions.
  - **BCI:** Broadcast Interference.
  - **TVI:** Television Interference.
  - **Blocking:** Strong signal overloads front-end.
  - **Desensitisation:** Noise floor rises, weak signals disappear.
  - **Cross-modulation:** Modulation of a strong unwanted signal is transferred to the wanted carrier.
  - **Intermodulation:** Two or more signals mix in a non-linear stage (TX PA or RX Front-end) producing sum/difference products (e.g., 2f1 - f2).
  - **LFD (Audio Rectification):** RF picked up by audio cables/circuits and rectified by PN junctions (transistors/diodes) in the amplifier. Heard as distorted speech (AM/SSB) or clicks (CW).
  - **Key Clicks:** Broadband interference caused by fast rise/fall times in CW keying.
  - **Chirp:** Frequency instability of oscillator during keying.
  - **Tjoep:** Chirp-like sound at start of transmission (warm-up).
- **Mitigation / Filters:**
  - **Mains Filter:** L-C filter to stop conducted interference.
  - **Mains Choke (Ferrietklem):** Ferrite ring on mains cable (Common Mode Choke).
    - Material: Type 43 or 31 for HF/VHF.
  - **High Pass Filter (HPF):** On TV/Receiver antenna input to block HF amateur bands.
  - **Low Pass Filter (LPF):** On Transmitter output to block Harmonics. (e.g. Pi-filter / T-filter).
  - **Band Stop (Notch):** Blocks specific frequency.
  - **Decoupling:** Capacitors (1-10nF) across audio inputs/speaker terminals to bypass RF.
  - **Shielding:** Faraday cage (grounded metal enclosure).
- **Routes of Entry:**
  - **Mains:** Conducted.
  - **Radiated:** Direct pickup by PCB/internal wiring.
  - **Cables:** Speaker wires, interconnects acting as antennas.
