# Inductors (Spoelen)

## 1. Structure and Function
An inductor (coil) stores electrical energy in a **magnetic field**.
*   **Construction:** A coil of conductive wire, often wound around a core.
*   **Symbol:** A series of loops (like a spring).

## 2. Inductance (Zelfinductie)
The property of a coil to oppose changes in current flow.
*   **Symbol:** $L$.
*   **Unit:** Henry ($H$).
*   **Effect:** If voltage of 1 V is applied to 1 H, current increases by 1 A per second.

### Self-Induction & Lenz's Law
When current changes, the magnetic field changes. This inducing a voltage (**Back EMF**) that opposes the change (Lenz's Law).
*   *Inertia for electricity:* Hard to start current, hard to stop current.

## 3. Formula
For a single-layer coil, inductance depends on:
$$L = \frac{\mu_0 \cdot \mu_r \cdot n^2 \cdot A}{l}$$

Key factors:
1.  **Turns ($n$):** Proportional to the **square** of turns ($n^2$). Double the turns = 4x Inductance.
2.  **Area ($A$):** Thicker coil = Higher inductance.
3.  **Length ($l$):** Longer coil (stretching it out) = **Lower** inductance.
4.  **Core Material ($\mu_r$):** Relative Permeability.
    *   Air: $\mu_r \approx 1$.
    *   Iron/Ferrite: $\mu_r \gg 1$ (Greatly increases inductance).

## 4. Applications
*   **Electromagnets:** Coil with iron core.
*   **Transformers:** Two magnetically coupled coils.
*   **Filters:** Blocking high frequencies (choke).
