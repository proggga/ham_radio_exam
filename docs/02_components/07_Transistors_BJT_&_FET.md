# Transistors

Active components used for amplification and switching.

## Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)
*   **Type:** Current-controlled.
*   **Structure:** NPN or PNP.
*   **Terminals:** Base (B), Collector (C), Emitter (E).
*   **Action:** A small Base current controls a large Collector current ($I_c = \beta \cdot I_b$).

## Field Effect Transistor (FET)
*   **Type:** Voltage-controlled.
*   **Terminals:** Gate (G), Drain (D), Source (S).
*   **Action:** Voltage on Gate creates an electric field controlling the channel current.
*   **Input Impedance:** Extremely high (no gate current flows).
