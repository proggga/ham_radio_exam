# Standard Component Values (E-Series)

[Resistors](01_Resistors.md) and capacitors are not manufactured in every possible value. They follow logarithmic series known as E-series (Renard series).

## E12 Series (10% Tolerance)
Values per decade (10-100):
10, 12, 15, 18, 22, 27, 33, 39, 47, 56, 68, 82.

## E24 Series (5% Tolerance)
Provides higher resolution steps between values.
