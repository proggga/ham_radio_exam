# Semiconductor Physics

Semiconductors are materials whose conductivity lies between conductors and insulators and can be controlled.

## Materials
*   **Silicon (Si):** The most common semiconductor. 4 valence electrons.
*   **Germanium (Ge):** Older, higher leakage, lower voltage drop.

## Doping (Dotering)
Adding impurities to pure Silicon to create charge carriers.
*   **N-type:** Doped with **Pentavalent** atoms (5 valence electrons, e.g., Arsenic). Result: Extra free **Electrons**.
*   **P-type:** Doped with **Trivalent** atoms (3 valence electrons, e.g., Boron). Result: Electron deficiencies called **Holes** (Gaten).

## The PN Junction
When P-type and N-type are joined:
1.  Charges diffuse across the boundary.
2.  Recombination creates a **Depletion Zone** (no free carriers).
3.  This zone acts as a barrier potential (~0.7V for Si).
