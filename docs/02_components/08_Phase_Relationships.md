# Phase Relationships

In AC circuits, Voltage ($U$) and Current ($I$) are not always in step with each other.

## Resistive Circuits
In pure **[Resistors](01_Resistors.md)**, Voltage and Current are **in phase** ($0^\circ$ difference). Peaks occur at the same time.

## Reactive Circuits
In reactive components, energy storage causes a $90^\circ$ ($\pi/2$ radians) phase shift.

### Inductors ($L$)
Voltage **leads** Current by $90^\circ$.
*   *Mnemonics*:
    *   **LUI**: **L**, **U** (Voltage) comes before **I** (Current).
    *   **ELI**: **E** (EMF/Voltage) **L**eads **I** in **L**.

### Capacitors ($C$)
Current **leads** Voltage by $90^\circ$.
*   *Mnemonics*:
    *   **CIU**: **C**, **I** (Current) comes before **U** (Voltage).
    *   **ICE**: **I** leads **E** (Voltage) in **C**.

### Graph Reading Tip
When looking at a Time-Domain graph (Voltage/Current vs Time):
*   **Left** is Earlier. **Right** is Later.
*   If Wave A crosses zero (going up) *before* (to the left of) Wave B, then **Wave A Leads Wave B**.
*   *Mnemonic:* "Left Leads".
