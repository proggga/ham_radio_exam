# Transformer Losses

Real transformers are not 100% efficient. [Energy](../01_electricity/08_Power_and_Energy.md) is lost as heat.

## Types of Loss

### 1. Copper Loss ($I^2R$)
Heating in the wire windings due to resistance.
*   Reduced by using thicker wire for high current windings.

### 2. Iron Loss (Core Loss)
*   **Eddy Currents (Wervelstromen)**: Circulating currents induced in the conductive core material.
    *   *Solution*: Use laminated cores or ferrite.
*   **Hysteresis**: Energy lost flipping the magnetic domains in the core material.
    *   *Solution*: Use soft iron or specific ferrite mixes.

### 3. Flux Leakage
Magnetic field lines that escape the core and do not link the primary to the secondary.
*   Reduced by using **Toroidal** cores.
