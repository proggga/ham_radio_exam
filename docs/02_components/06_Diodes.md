# Diodes

A diode is a two-terminal component formed by a single PN junction that allows current to flow in only one direction.

## Operation
*   **Forward Bias (Doorlaat):** Current flows if voltage > **Threshold Voltage** (~0.7V Si, ~0.2V Ge).
*   **Reverse Bias (Sper):** Current is blocked (except for tiny leakage).

## Types
*   **Rectifier Diode:** Converts AC to DC.
*   **Zener Diode:** Conducts in reverse at a specific "Zener Voltage". Used for voltage regulation.
*   **LED:** Emits light when forward biased.
*   **Varicap:** Acts as a variable capacitor in reverse bias (Depletion zone width varies with voltage).
