# Reactance (Reactantie)

Reactance ($X$) is the opposition to AC current flow caused by capacitance or inductance. It depends on frequency.
*   **Unit**: Ohm ($\Omega$).

## Inductive Reactance ($X_L$)
Increases with frequency (Proportional).
*   **Formula**: $X_L = 2\pi f L = \omega L$
*   **Behavior**:
    *   DC ($0 Hz$): $X_L = 0$ (Short circuit).
    *   High Freq: $X_L$ is high (Open circuit).

## Capacitive Reactance ($X_C$)
Decreases with frequency (Inversely proportional).
*   **Formula**: $X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C} = \frac{1}{\omega C}$
*   **Behavior**:
    *   DC ($0 Hz$): $X_C = \infty$ (Open circuit).
    *   High Freq: $X_C$ is low (Short circuit).
