# Eindterm 11: Rules & Procedures (Gebruiksregels)

## Amateur Radio Activities
Amateur radio is a versatile hobby with many different aspects:
*   **Homebrew & Experimentation:** Building radios or antennas.
*   **DXing:** The pursuit of contacts with distant or rare stations ("DX").
*   **Contesting:** Competitive operating where the goal is to make as many contacts as possible within a set time, often exchanging specific codes rather than chatting.
*   **Field Days:** Operating portable stations from temporary locations (e.g., open fields) to practice emergency readiness and enjoy low-noise reception.
*   **Fox Hunting (Vossenjacht):** A sport involving finding hidden transmitters using direction-finding equipment.

## The Contact (QSO)
A standard contact typically follows a structured format:
1.  **Calling CQ:** A general call inviting anyone to reply (e.g., "CQ CQ CQ de PA0ABC").
2.  **The Exchange:** Once contact is established, operators exchange:
    *   **Signal Report (RST):**
        *   **R (Readability):** 1-5 (1=Unreadable, 5=Perfect).
        *   **S (Strength):** 1-9 (Signal strength, S9 is strong).
        *   **T (Tone):** 1-9 (CW only, 9=Perfect sine wave).
    *   **Name & QTH:** The operator's name and location (often including the **Maidenhead Grid Locator**).
3.  **Closing:** The contact ends with "73" (Best Regards).

### QSL Cards
A **QSL card** is a written confirmation of a radio contact.
*   **Physical Cards:** Often sent via a **QSL Bureau** (a service run by national societies like VERON/VRZA to bulk-mail cards cheaply) or directly by mail.
*   **Digital:** Services like **Logbook of the World (LoTW)** or eQSL provide electronic confirmation, which is increasingly used for awards.

## Listening (WebSDR)
You don't need a transmitter to learn procedures. **WebSDR** sites (like the University of Twente's receiver) allow anyone to listen to amateur bands via a web browser, which is an excellent way to become familiar with QSO formats and band activity.

## Phonetic Alphabet
Used to spell out call signs and names clearly.
*   **A-E:** Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo.
*   **F-J:** Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett.
*   **K-O:** Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar.
*   **P-T:** Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango.
*   **U-Z:** Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu.

## Q-Codes
Three-letter codes starting with Q. A question mark makes it a question.
*   **QRA:** Name of station.
*   **QRG:** Frequency.
*   **QRK:** Readability (1-5).
*   **QRL:** Is the frequency busy?
*   **QRM:** Man-made interference. See [Interference](09_interference/01_types.md).
*   **QRN:** Natural interference (Static). See [Noise](01_electricity/10_ac_signals.md).
*   **QRO:** High power.
*   **QRP:** Low power.
*   **QRT:** Closing down / Stop sending.
*   **QRV:** Ready.
*   **QRX:** Wait / Call back at...
*   **QRZ:** Who is calling me?
*   **QSB:** Fading. See [Propagation](07_propagation/03_ionosphere.md).
*   **QSL:** Confirm receipt / Can you confirm.
*   **QSO:** Radio contact.
*   **QSY:** Change frequency.
*   **QTH:** Location.

## Abbreviations (CW/Digital)
*   **BK:** Break (Back to you).
*   **CQ:** General call (Seek You).
*   **CW:** Continuous Wave (Morse). See [Modulation](01_electricity/11_modulation.md).
*   **DE:** From.
*   **K:** Over (Invitation to transmit).
*   **PSE:** Please.
*   **R:** Received / Roger.
*   **RX / TX:** Receiver / Transmitter.
*   **UR:** Your.
*   **73:** Best regards.
*   **88:** Love and kisses.
*   **AR:** End of transmission (prosign).
*   **SK:** End of contact / Silent Key (deceased) (prosign).
