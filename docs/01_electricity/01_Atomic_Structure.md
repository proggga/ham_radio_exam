# Atomic Structure

All matter consists of **atoms**, which are the smallest particles of an element that retain its properties.

## Components
An atom is composed of:
1.  **Nucleus (Kern):** The central core, containing:
    *   **Protons:** Positively charged particles.
    *   **Neutrons:** Neutral particles (no charge).
2.  **Electron Shells (Schillen):** Orbits around the nucleus containing:
    *   **Electrons:** Negatively charged particles.

## Electron Configuration
Electrons orbit in specific shells with fixed capacities:
*   **Innermost shell (K):** Max 2 electrons.
*   **Second shell (L):** Max 8 electrons.
*   **Third shell (M):** Max 18 electrons.

The behavior of electrons in the outermost shell (Valence electrons) determines the chemical and electrical properties of the material (see Conductors and Insulators).
