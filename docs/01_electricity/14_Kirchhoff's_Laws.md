# Kirchhoff's Laws

Gustav [Kirchhoff](13_Circuits_and_Kirchhoff's_Laws.md) described two fundamental laws that govern the conservation of charge and energy in electrical circuits.

## First Law: Current Law (KCL)
**"The sum of currents flowing into a node equals the sum of currents flowing out."**

*   **Formula**: $\Sigma I_{in} = \Sigma I_{out}$
*   **Principle**: Conservation of Charge. Charge cannot accumulate at a node; what goes in must come out.
*   **Application**: This law is the basis for understanding [Parallel Circuits](16_Parallel_Circuits.md), where current splits into multiple branches.

## Second Law: Voltage Law (KVL)
**"The algebraic sum of all voltages in a closed loop is zero."**

*   **Formula**: $\Sigma U = 0$
*   **Alternative View**: The Source Voltage equals the sum of Voltage Drops across components in the loop.
*   **Principle**: Conservation of [Energy](08_Power_and_Energy.md). A charge moving around a loop gains energy from the source and loses it all in the components before returning to the start.
*   **Application**: This law is fundamental to [Series Circuits](15_Series_Circuits.md).
