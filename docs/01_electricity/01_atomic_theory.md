# Atomic Theory & Conductivity

## 1. Structure of Matter
All matter consists of **atoms**. An atom is the smallest particle of an element.
*   **Nucleus (Kern):** Contains **Protons** (positive charge) and **Neutrons** (neutral/no charge).
*   **Electron Shells (Schillen):** **Electrons** (negative charge) orbit the nucleus in specific shells.
    *   The innermost shell holds max 2 electrons.
    *   The second shell holds max 8 electrons.
    *   The third shell holds max 18 electrons.

## 2. Electrical Charge
*   **Neutral Atom:** Number of Protons = Number of Electrons. Net charge is 0.
*   **Ion:** An atom that has lost or gained electrons.
    *   **Positive Ion:** Lost electron(s) (Protons > Electrons).
    *   **Negative Ion:** Gained electron(s) (Electrons > Protons).
*   **Unit:** The unit of charge is the **Coulomb (C)**.
    *   $1 \text{ C} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.
    *   Charge of 1 electron $e \approx -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$.
*   **[Current (I, Ampere)](02_ohm_law.md):** Flow of charge (Q) per time (t).
*   **Direction:** [Technical vs Electron Flow](02_ohm_law.md#direction-of-current).
*   **[Voltage (U, Volt)](02_ohm_law.md):** Potential difference.
*   **[Resistance (R, Ohm)](02_ohm_law.md):** Opposition to current flow.
*   **Specific Resistance:** See [Resistivity](03_resistivity.md).

## 3. Conductors vs Insulators
The behavior of electrons in the outermost shell determines conductivity.
*   **Conductors (Geleiders):** Materials where outer electrons are loosely bound and can move freely from atom to atom (e.g., Metals like Copper, Silver, Gold, Aluminum).
*   **Insulators (Isolatoren):** Materials where electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus and cannot move freely (e.g., Glass, Plastic, Rubber, Air, Ceramic).
*   **Semiconductors (Halfgeleiders):** Conductivity is between conductor and insulator (e.g., Silicon, Germanium). Covered later.

> **Note:** There is no perfect conductor (except superconductors at low temps) and no perfect insulator (everything conducts if voltage is high enough -> Breakdown).
