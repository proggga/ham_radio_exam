# Map: Circuits & Kirchhoff's Laws

This map covers the fundamental rules for analyzing electrical circuits.

## Core Laws
*   Kirchhoff's Laws - Conservation of Current (KCL) and Voltage (KVL).
*   Voltage, Current, and Ohm's Law - The relationship  = I \times R$.

## Circuit Topologies
*   Series Circuits - Components in a chain (Voltage divides).
*   Parallel Circuits - Components side-by-side (Current divides).
*   Voltage Dividers - Practical application of series circuits for setting levels.

## Analysis Tools
*   Multimeters (Universeelmeters) - Measuring V, I, and R.
*   Reactance & Impedance - AC circuit analysis.
