# Ions

An **Ion** is an atom (or molecule) that has a non-zero net electrical charge because it has lost or gained electrons.

## Types of Ions
1.  **Positive Ion (Cation):**
    *   The atom has **lost** one or more electrons.
    *   Protons > Electrons.
2.  **Negative Ion (Anion):**
    *   The atom has **gained** one or more electrons.
    *   Electrons > Protons.

## Relevance
Ionization is critical in understanding:
*   **Batteries:** Movement of ions creates current in electrolytes (see Voltage and Current Sources).
*   **Propagation:** The **Ionosphere** is a layer of ionized gas in the atmosphere that reflects radio waves (see The Ionosphere).
