# Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic Fields

## 1. Electric Field (Elektrisch Veld)
An electric field exists between two points with a potential difference (voltage), such as the plates of a capacitor.
*   **Force:** Exerts force on electric charges ($F = Q \times E$).
*   **Field Strength ($E$):**
    $$E = \frac{U}{d}$$
    *   $U$ = Voltage (Volt)
    *   $d$ = Distance (meters)
    *   Unit: Volts per meter ($V/m$).
*   **Shielding (Afscherming):** A conductive enclosure (**Faraday Cage**) blocks static electric fields.

## 2. Magnetic Field (Magnetisch Veld)
A magnetic field is created by moving electric charges (current).
*   **Source:** Current flowing through a wire or coil.
*   **Direction:** Determined by the **Right-Hand Grip Rule** (Thumb = Current, Fingers = Field lines).
*   **Shielding:**
    *   Conductive materials (Copper/Aluminum) do **NOT** shield against static magnetic fields.
    *   High-permeability materials (e.g., **Mu-metal**, Soft Iron) are required to divert magnetic flux.

## 3. Electromagnetic Field (Elektromagnetisch Veld)
Radio waves are electromagnetic waves consisting of oscillating Electric ($E$) and Magnetic ($H$) fields.
*   **Orientation:** $E$ and $H$ fields are perpendicular (90 degrees) to each other and to the direction of propagation.
*   **Velocity ($c$):** Speed of light $\approx 300,000,000 \text{ m/s}$ (in vacuum).
*   **Wavelength ($\lambda$):** Distance a wave travels in one cycle.
    $$v = f \times \lambda \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda = \frac{300}{f \text{ (MHz)}}$$
*   **Polarisation:** Defined by the orientation of the **Electric Field ($E$)**.
    *   *Horizontal:* E-field is horizontal.
    *   *Vertical:* E-field is vertical.
    *   *Circular:* E-field rotates.
