# Map: Power & Energy

This map covers the concepts of work and power in electrical systems.

## Fundamentals
*   [Electrical Power](09_Electrical_Power.md) - Rate of work (=UI$).
*   [Electrical Energy](10_Electrical_Energy.md) - Total work over time (=Pt$).

## Practical Application
*   [Electrical Dissipation](11_Electrical_Dissipation.md) - Heat loss and power ratings.
