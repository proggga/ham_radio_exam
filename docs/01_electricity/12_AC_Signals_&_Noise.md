# AC Signals & Noise

This map covers the behavior of Alternating Current (AC) and noise signals.

## AC Theory
*   **AC Signal Parameters** - Frequency, Period, Amplitude, Phase.
*   **RMS Voltage** - Effective value ({eff}$).
*   **Complex Waveforms & Fourier** - Square/Triangle waves and Harmonics (Fourier).

## Noise
*   **Noise Types** - Thermal, Shot, and Atmospheric noise.
