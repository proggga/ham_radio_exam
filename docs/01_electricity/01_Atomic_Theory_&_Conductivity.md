# Atomic Theory & Conductivity

This is a structure note for concepts related to the physics of matter and electricity.

## Core Concepts
*   **[Atomic Structure](02_Atomic_Structure.md)** - The building blocks (Protons, Neutrons, Electrons).
*   **[Electrical Charge (Coulomb)](03_Electrical_Charge_Coulomb.md)** - The fundamental property that causes electrical force (Coulombs).
*   **[Ions (Ionisation)](04_Ions_Ionisation.md)** - Atoms with net charge (Ionization).

## Material Properties
*   **[Conductors and Insulators](05_Conductors_and_Insulators.md)** - How materials behave based on their electron structure.
*   **[Resistivity (Soortelijke Weerstand)](06_Resistivity_Soortelijke_Weerstand.md)** - The specific resistance of materials.
*   **[Semiconductors](../02_components/15_Semiconductors.md)** - Materials that can act as either.

## Connected Topics
*   **[Voltage, Current, and Ohm's Law](07_Voltage,_Current,_and_Ohm's_Law.md)** - How charge flow (Current) relates to force (Voltage).
*   **[The Ionosphere](../07_propagation/12_The_Ionosphere.md)** - Large scale ionization affecting radio waves.
