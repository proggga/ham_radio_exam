# Map: Matching & SWR

This map covers the theory and practice of connecting transmitters to antennas.

## Concepts
*   Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) - The metric of mismatch.
*   Smith Chart - The tool for visualizing impedance.

## Equipment
*   Baluns - Matching Balanced to Unbalanced.
*   Antenna Tuning Unit (ATU) - Impedance matching device.
