# Loop Antennas

## Small Magnetic Loop
A loop with a circumference much smaller than the wavelength ($< \lambda/10$).
*   **Tuning**: Uses a high-voltage variable capacitor to tune to resonance.
*   **Characteristics**:
    *   **High Q**: Very narrow bandwidth (needs re-tuning often).
    *   **[Noise](../01_electricity/26_AC_Signals_&_Noise.md) Rejection**: Excellent at rejecting E-field noise (man-made QRM).
    *   **Size**: Compact, good for limited space.

## Large Loop (Quad Loop)
A loop with a circumference of approximately one wavelength ($\approx \lambda$).
*   **[Impedance](../01_electricity/21_Impedance_Impedantie.md)**: $\approx 100-120 \Omega$.
*   **Gain**: Slight gain over a dipole (~1-2 [dB](../00_basic_skills.md)).
