# Map: Transmission Lines

This map covers the connection between the transmitter and the antenna.

## Hardware
*   [Transmission Line Types](14_Transmission_Line_Types.md) - Coaxial vs. Open Wire.
*   [Transmission Line Loss](15_Transmission_Line_Loss.md) - Attenuation factors.

## Physics & Math
*   **[Velocity Factor](16_Velocity_Factor.md)** - Speed of light in a cable.
*   **[Impedance Transformation](17_Impedance_Transformation.md)** - Using lines as transformers ($\lambda/4$) or Stubs.
