# Map: Transmission Lines

This map covers the connection between the transmitter and the antenna.

## Hardware
*   Transmission Line Types - Coaxial vs. Open Wire.
*   Transmission Line Loss - Attenuation factors.

## Physics & Math
*   **Velocity Factor** - Speed of light in a cable.
*   **Impedance Transformation** - Using lines as transformers ($\lambda/4$) or Stubs.
