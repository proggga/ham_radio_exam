# Antenna & Tower Safety

Installing and maintaining antennas involves physical risks that must be managed to prevent injury or death.

## 1. Power Lines
**The #1 Killer in Amateur Radio.**
*   **Rule**: Never place an antenna where it could fall onto power lines.
*   **Safe Distance**: Height of the antenna + **10 feet** (safety margin).
*   **Utility Poles**: **NEVER** attach antennas or guy wires to utility poles.

## 2. Tower Work
*   **Climbing Gear**: Always use an approved climbing harness and safety lanyard.
*   **Buddy System**: Never climb alone. Have a ground observer wearing a hard hat.
*   **Crank-up Towers**: NEVER climb a crank-up tower unless it is fully retracted or mechanically locked (blocked).
*   **Weather**: Do not climb in high winds, rain, or if lightning is in the area.

## 3. Grounding (Lightning Protection)
Proper grounding shunts lightning energy to earth before it enters the station.
*   **Ground Rods**: 8-foot (2.4m) copper-clad steel rods driven into the ground.
    *   *Bonding:* All ground rods (tower, station, mains service) must be bonded together with heavy gauge wire or copper strap to prevent voltage potential differences.
*   **Tower Legs**: Each leg should have its own ground rod.
*   **Connections**: Short, direct, and free of sharp bends (lightning does not like corners).
*   **Lightning Arrestors**: Install in coaxial feedlines at the entry point to the building.

## 4. Mechanical Safety
*   **Guy Wires**: Use safety wire on turnbuckles to prevent them from vibrating loose.
*   **Insulation**: Ensure antenna ends (high voltage) are out of reach of people to prevent RF burns.
