# Operating Rules (Netherlands)

Key regulations for amateur radio operation in the Netherlands (based on Telecommunicatiewet and Frequentiebesluit).

## General Requirements
*   **Registration**: You must be registered with the **RDI** (Rijksinspectie Digitale Infrastructuur, formerly Agentschap Telecom).
*   **License**: You must hold a valid certificate (N or F) for the equipment you operate.
    *   *N-amateur using F-equipment:* Only allowed if an F-amateur is present and supervising.
*   **Identification**: You must transmit your call sign:
    *   At the **start** and **end** of each transmission (or series of transmissions).
    *   At least once every **5 minutes** during the transmission.

## Station Status
*   **Primary Status**: You are the main user. You have protection against interference.
*   **Secondary Status**: You may use the band but:
    1.  Must **not cause interference** to primary users.
    2.  Cannot claim protection from interference by primary users.
    3.  *Note:* Amateurs often have secondary status on bands shared with military or other services (e.g. 70cm, 23cm, parts of 80m).

## Restrictions
*   **Third Party Traffic**: Messages for/on behalf of non-amateurs are **forbidden** (unless in emergencies).
*   **Encryption**: International communications must **not** be encoded to hide meaning (Secret codes). Exception: Control signals for satellites.
*   **Broadcasting**: Sending music, radio programs, or news to the general public is **forbidden**.
*   **Commercial Use**: Financial gain or business communication is **forbidden**.

## Responsibility
*   The registered amateur is responsible for the station's operation, even if someone else is speaking (e.g. under supervision).
*   **[Interference](../09_interference/03_Mixing_Products_Interference.md)**: You must not cause "inadmissible" interference.

## Formal Definitions (Exam Topics)
*   **Transmission Power (Zendvermogen)**: Defined as the average power delivered to the antenna transmission line by the transmitter, during one radio frequency cycle at the crest of the modulation envelope (**[PEP](../01_electricity/32_Analogue_Modulation_&_AM.md)**).
    *   *Dutch:* "Het door de direct met de antenne-inrichting te koppelen trap van het radiozendapparaat afgegeven gemiddeld vermogen, gerekend over een periode van de hoogfrequent uitgangswisselspanning tijdens het maximum van de omhullende."
*   **EMC (Elektromagnetische Compatibiliteit)**: The ability of equipment to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to other equipment in that environment.
*   **Radio Equipment (Radioapparaten)**: Equipment that intentionally transmits or receives radio waves for communication or radiodetermination.
