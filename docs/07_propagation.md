# Eindterm 7: Propagation (Propagatie)

- **Basics:**
  - **Velocity:** c = 300,000 km/s.
  - **Wavelength:** lambda = c / f.
  - **Polarisation:** Defined by E-field vector (Horizontal/Vertical).

### 7.1 HF (High Frequency 3-30 MHz)
- **Ground Wave (Grondgolf/Bodemgolf):** Follows earth curvature. Best at low freq. Vertical polarisation preferred.
- **Sky Wave (Ruimtegolf):** Refracted by Ionosphere.
  - **Layers:**
    - **D Layer (60-90 km):** Absorbs low HF (160/80m) during day. Exists only in sunlight.
    - **E Layer (100-120 km):** Reflects lower HF. Sporadic E (Es) reflects VHF in summer.
    - **F Layers (150-400+ km):** F1 (lower/day), F2 (higher/day & night). Main DX layer.
  - **Solar Cycle:** 11 years. Sunspots (Zonnevlekken) indicate activity. More flux = Higher ionization = Higher MUF.
  - **Critical Frequency:** Highest freq reflected when sent straight up (Vertical incidence).
  - **MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency):** Highest freq for a specific path. Depends on angle of incidence.
  - **LUF (Lowest Usable Frequency):** Lowest freq not absorbed by D-layer.
  - **Skip Distance (Sprongafstand):** Distance to where the signal returns to earth.
  - **Dead Zone (Dode zone):** Area between end of Ground Wave and first Skip return.
  - **Fading (QSB):** Signal fluctuation due to multipath interference (e.g., ground + sky wave, or O-wave + X-wave).
  - **Gray Line:** Best propagation at sunrise/sunset.
  - **Path:** Long Path vs Short Path. Polar Path (via poles).
  - **Solar Activity:** SFI (Solar Flux Index) at 10.7cm. Higher = Better.
  - **Indices:** K-index and A-index (Geomagnetic). Lower = Better.

### 7.2 VHF/UHF (> 30 MHz)
- **Troposphere:** Weather layer (0-10km).
  - **Line of Sight (Zichtverbinding):** Direct wave.
  - **Radio Horizon:** 4/3 * Optical Horizon. d(km) approx 4.12 * sqrt(h(m)) for each antenna (Total = d1 + d2).
  - **Ducting:** Temperature Inversion (Warm air over Cold) traps signal. Long distance.
  - **Knife-Edge Diffraction:** Bending around sharp obstacles.
  - **Troposcatter:** Scatter from turbulence (200-800 km).
  - **Rain Scatter:** VHF/UHF scatter from rain.
- **Exotic Modes:**
  - **Aurora:** Reflection off ionized zones at magnetic poles. Distorted audio (Whisper/Hiss).
  - **Meteor Scatter:** Reflections off ionized trails of meteors. Short bursts.
  - **EME (Moonbounce):** Moon as passive reflector. High path loss (~250-270 dB).
  - **Satellite:** Active transponders. Doppler shift compensation needed.
