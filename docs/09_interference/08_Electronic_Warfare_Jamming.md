# Electronic Warfare (EW)

Electronic Warfare involves the use of electromagnetic energy to attack or protect access to the spectrum. While primarily a military concept, radio amateurs should be aware of jamming types and countermeasures (Electronic Protection).

## 1. Electronic Attack (EA) / Jamming
Deliberate radiation to disrupt communications.

### Types of Jamming Signals
*   **Spot Jamming**: Concentrated power on a single frequency.
*   **Barrage Jamming**: Jamming a wide band of frequencies simultaneously.
*   **Sweep Jamming**: A signal that sweeps back and forth across a band.
*   **Deception (Imitative)**: Entering a net and imitating the net control station to cause confusion.

### Characteristic Sounds
*   **Random [Noise](../01_electricity/26_AC_Signals_&_Noise.md)**: Synthetic radio noise (hiss).
*   **Stepped Tones**: Tones changing in pitch (like bagpipes).
*   **Wobbler**: Varying pitch tone.
*   **Pulse**: Regular tapping or clicking.
*   **Spark**: Broadband buzzing (like an old spark gap transmitter).
*   **Gulls**: Warbling sound.

## 2. Electronic Protection (EP)
Measures taken to protect friendly communications from jamming.

### Anti-Jamming Techniques
1.  **[Directional Antennas](../06_antennas/06_Directional_Antennas_Beams.md)**: Point the null of the antenna toward the jammer to reduce its signal strength.
2.  **Terrain Masking**: Put a hill or obstacle between the receiver and the jammer.
3.  **Power**: Increase transmitter power (Burn-through) - only effective if the jammer is weak.
4.  **Mode Change**: Switch to a mode more resistant to jamming (e.g., [CW](../01_electricity/33_CW_Abbreviations_&_Prosigns.md) is often readable through jamming where Voice is not).
5.  **Frequency Change**: Move to an alternate frequency (QSY).
6.  **Frequency Hopping**: Rapidly switching frequencies in a pseudo-random pattern (e.g., SINCGARS, Spread Spectrum).

## 3. Reporting (MIJI)
In a military context, interference incidents are reported via a **MIJI** report:
*   **M**eaconing (Decoy beacons).
*   **I**ntrusion (Unauthorized users).
*   **J**amming (Deliberate interference).
*   **I**nterference (Unintentional).
