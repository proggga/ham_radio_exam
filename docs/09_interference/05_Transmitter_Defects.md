# Transmitter Defects

Poorly designed or adjusted transmitters cause interference.

## Chirp / Tjoep
A frequency instability during [CW](../01_electricity/33_CW_Abbreviations_&_Prosigns.md) keying.
*   **Mechanism**: When the key is pressed, the power supply voltage sags or the load on the oscillator changes. This causes the oscillator frequency to shift while the signal is being generated.
*   **Chirp**: A continuous frequency drift during the dash/dot.
*   **Tjoep**: A specific sound ("Yoop") caused by the oscillator starting up off-frequency and drifting to the correct frequency at the start of a character.
*   **Fix**: Stabilize the power supply (Zener diode) or use a **Buffer/Isolator** stage between the Oscillator and the PA.

## Key Clicks
Broadband sidebands generated by hard switching in CW.
*   **Cause**: Rise and fall times of the signal are too fast (square wave edges contain many harmonics).
*   **Sound**: Clicking or thumping heard across the band, even far from the frequency.
*   **Fix**: **Key Click [Filter](../03_circuits/03_Filters_&_Resonance.md)** (Lag network / LC filter) in the keying line to round off the edges (shaping).

## Splatter
Broadband noise caused by overmodulation in [AM](../01_electricity/32_Analogue_Modulation_&_AM.md)/[SSB](../01_electricity/34_Single_Sideband_SSB.md).
*   **Cause**: Driving the Power Amplifier into saturation (clipping) or excessive Audio gain (ALC inactive).
*   **Effect**: Signal becomes very wide, interfering with adjacent channels.

## Phase Noise (Faseruis)
A "cloud" of noise surrounding the carrier caused by oscillator jitter.
*   **Effect**: Reciprocal Mixing in nearby receivers.
