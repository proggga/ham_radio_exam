# Solar Indices & Space Weather

Space weather, driven by the Sun, dramatically affects [HF](01_Propagation_Basics.md) radio propagation. Monitoring these indices helps predict band conditions.

## Sunspots and the Solar Cycle
*   **Sunspots**: Cooler, dark areas on the Sun's surface associated with intense magnetic activity.
*   **Effect**: More sunspots = More Ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation reaching Earth = **Higher Ionization** of the [Ionosphere](12_The_Ionosphere.md) (F-layer).
*   **Result**: Better [HF](01_Propagation_Basics.md) propagation on higher frequencies (10m, 15m, 20m) and higher [MUF](15_MUF,_LUF,_and_Critical_Frequency.md).
*   **Cycle**: The number of sunspots follows an approximately **11-year cycle**.

## Solar Disturbances
### 1. Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance (SID)
*   **Cause**: Solar Flares (bright eruptions) emitting bursts of X-rays.
*   **Effect**: drastically increases ionization in the **D-Layer**.
*   **Result**: **Radio Blackout** on [HF](01_Propagation_Basics.md) daylight paths. Signals are absorbed, not reflected. Receivers go silent.
*   **Duration**: Minutes to hours.

### 2. Geomagnetic Storms (Ionospheric Storms)
*   **Cause**: Charged particles (Coronal Mass Ejections - CME) from the Sun hitting Earth's magnetic field (20-40 hours after the event).
*   **Effect**: Disturbs the F-layer, causing turbulence and lower ionization.
*   **Result**:
    *   **Lower MUF**: High bands close.
    *   **Flutter [Fading](16_Fading_QSB.md)**: Rapid signal strength variations.
    *   **Auroras**: Enhanced propagation at [VHF](07_VHFUHF_Bands_6m,_2m,_70cm.md) (Auroral scatter) but poor HF.

## Key Indices (General)
*   **Solar Flux Index (SFI)**: Measure of radio noise from the sun at 2800 MHz (10.7 cm). Correlates well with sunspot number. Higher is better for HF.
*   **K-Index**: A 3-hour measure of local geomagnetic activity (Scale 0-9). Lower (0-2) is quiet/good. Higher (5+) indicates a storm.
*   **A-Index**: Daily average of geomagnetic activity. Low is good.
