# Propagation Basics

## 1. Electromagnetic Waves
Radio waves consist of oscillating Electric ($E$) and Magnetic ($H$) fields.
*   **Orientation:** $E$ and $H$ are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of travel.
*   **Velocity:** $c \approx 300,000 \text{ km/s}$.
*   **Wavelength:** $\lambda = c / f$.

## 2. Polarization
Defined by the orientation of the **Electric Field ($E$)**.
*   **Horizontal:** Dipole parallel to the ground.
*   **Vertical:** Ground plane / vertical whip.
*   **Cross Polarization:** Loss of signal (~20-30 dB) if TX is Vertical and RX is Horizontal (or vice versa). Important for VHF/UHF/Line of Sight. Less important for HF Skywave (ionosphere twists polarization).

## 3. Inverse Square Law
As the wave spreads out from a point source, power density decreases with the square of the distance.
*   Double the distance = 1/4 the power (-6 dB).
