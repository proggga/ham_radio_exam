# The Ionosphere

The ionosphere is a region of the upper atmosphere ionized by solar radiation (UV/X-ray). It enables worldwide HF communication.

## 1. Layers
*   **D Layer (60-90 km):**
    *   Exists **only during daylight**.
    *   **Absorbs** low frequencies (160m, 80m, 40m).
    *   Disappears at night -> Low bands open up for DX.
*   **E Layer (100-120 km):**
    *   Reflects signals.
    *   **Sporadic E ($E_s$):** Intense patches of ionization in summer. Can reflect VHF (6m, 2m) over 1000-2000 km.
*   **F Layers (150-400+ km):** The main DX reflectors.
    *   **Day:** Splits into **F1** (lower) and **F2** (higher).
    *   **Night:** Merges into a single **F** layer.

## 2. Solar Cycle
*   **Sunspots (Zonnevlekken):** Indicators of solar activity. Cycle is approx **11 years**.
*   **Solar Flux (SFI):** Measure of ionizing radiation.
    *   **High Flux (Max):** High ionization. F-layers become dense. High frequencies (10m, 12m, 15m) reflect well.
    *   **Low Flux (Min):** Low ionization. High frequencies pass through into space. DX limited to lower bands (20m, 40m).

## 3. Key Frequencies
*   **Critical Frequency ($f_c$):** The highest frequency sent *straight up* (Vertical Incidence) that returns to earth.
*   **MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency):** The highest frequency that will support communication between two specific points.
    *   Depends on the angle of incidence (lower angle = higher MUF).
    *   Usually higher than the Critical Frequency.
*   **LUF (Lowest Usable Frequency):** The lowest frequency that is not absorbed (mostly by the D-layer).
*   **Operating Window:** The range between LUF and MUF.

## 4. Fading (QSB)
Variation in signal strength.
*   **Multipath:** Signal arrives via two paths (e.g., 1 hop vs 2 hops) that go in and out of phase.
*   **Polarization:** Ionosphere twists the polarization (Faraday rotation). Linear antennas may cross-polarize.
