# Solar Cycle & Propagation

The ionosphere is created by solar radiation (UV and X-rays). Its density follows the sun's activity.

## The Solar Cycle
*   **11-Year Cycle**: The main sunspot cycle (Maximum to Minimum to Maximum).
*   **27-Day Cycle**: The rotation period of the sun on its axis.
    *   *Effect:* Good propagation conditions often recur every 27 days as active sunspot groups rotate back into view.

## Impact on Bands
*   **Solar Maximum (High Flux)**:
    *   High ionization density in F-layers.
    *   **High Bands (10m, 12m, 15m)**: Open worldwide. Reflect well.
*   **Solar Minimum (Low Flux)**:
    *   Low ionization.
    *   High frequencies pass through the ionosphere into space.
    *   DX is limited to **Lower Bands (20m, 40m, 80m)**.

## Solar Disturbances (Irregular Variations)
*   **SID (Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance)**:
    *   *Cause:* Solar Flares (X-Rays).
    *   *Effect:* Sudden, drastic increase in **D-layer ionization** on the sunlit side of Earth.
    *   *Result:* Total radio blackout on [HF](01_Propagation_Basics.md) (absorption) lasting minutes to hours. Lower frequencies affected most.
*   **Geomagnetic Storms (Ionospheric Storms)**:
    *   *Cause:* Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) / Solar Wind hitting Earth's magnetic field.
    *   *Effect:* Disruption of F-layers, Auroras.
    *   *Result:* Lower MUF, high noise, signal flutter. Can last days.
