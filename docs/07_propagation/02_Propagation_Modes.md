# Map: Propagation Modes

This map covers the different paths radio waves take to travel from transmitter to receiver.

## Standard Modes
*   Ground Wave Propagation - LF/MF, following the surface.
*   Sky Wave Propagation - HF, skipping off the ionosphere.
*   Line of Sight Propagation (LOS) - VHF/UHF, direct path.

## Extended VHF/UHF Modes
*   Tropospheric Propagation - Ducting and scattering due to weather.
*   Exotic Propagation Modes - Aurora, Meteor Scatter, EME.
