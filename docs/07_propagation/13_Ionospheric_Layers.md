# Ionospheric Layers

The ionosphere consists of several layers of ionized gas at different heights.

## D Layer (60-90 km)
*   **Existence**: Daylight only.
*   **Effect**: **Absorbs** low frequencies (160m, 80m, 40m).
*   **Result**: Long-distance communication on low bands is poor during the day.

## E Layer (100-120 km)
*   **Effect**: Can reflect signals.
*   **[Sporadic E](10_Special_Propagation_Modes.md) ($E_s$)**: Intense, temporary ionization patches (mostly Summer). Can reflect [VHF](07_VHFUHF_Bands_6m,_2m,_70cm.md) (6m, 2m) over 1000-2000 km.

## F Layers (150-400+ km)
The primary reflectors for DX (worldwide) communication.
*   **Daytime**: Splits into **F1** (Lower) and **F2** (Higher).
*   **Nighttime**: Merges into a single **F** layer.
*   **Effect**: Reflects [HF](01_Propagation_Basics.md) signals back to earth (Skywave).
