# Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS)

NVIS is a propagation mode used to cover the "Skip Zone" area (typically 0 to 300 miles / 500 km) that is normally skipped by standard Sky Wave and out of reach of Ground Wave.

## Mechanism
*   **Vertical Launch**: Signals are transmitted straight up (near 90° elevation) into the ionosphere.
*   **Reflection**: The signals bounce off the F-layer and return to earth in an "umbrella" pattern covering the immediate area.
*   **Frequency Range**: Typically **2 MHz to 10 MHz**.
    *   *Daytime:* 4 - 8 MHz.
    *   *Nighttime:* 2 - 4 MHz.
    *   *Constraint:* Frequency must be below the Critical Frequency ($f_c$) of the F-layer, otherwise it punches through into space.

## Applications
*   **Military/Tactical**: Reliable communication in mountainous or jungle terrain where Line-of-Sight is blocked.
*   **Emergency Comms**: Covering a region/state during disasters when repeaters are down.

## Antennas
*   **Requirement**: High-angle radiation (cloud warmer).
*   **Horizontal [Dipole](../06_antennas/02_The_Dipole_Antenna.md)**: Mounted **low** (0.1$\lambda$ to 0.25$\lambda$ height, e.g., 2-5 meters high).
    *   Ground reflection reinforces the upward signal.
*   **Inverted V**: Center supported, ends close to ground.
*   **AS-2259**: Military NVIS antenna (crossed dipoles on a short mast).
