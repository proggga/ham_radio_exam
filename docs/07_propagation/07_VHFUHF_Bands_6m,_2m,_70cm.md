# VHF/UHF Bands

Bands above 30 MHz behave differently from [HF](01_Propagation_Basics.md), relying primarily on Line-of-Sight rather than ionospheric skip.

## 6m Band (50 MHz) - "The Magic Band"
*   **Nature:** Hybrid between HF and VHF.
*   **Modes:**
    *   **Sporadic E:** Common in summer.
    *   **F2 DX:** Only at peak Solar Max.
    *   **Meteor Scatter / Aurora:** Exotic modes.

## 2m Band (144 MHz)
*   **Primary Use:** Local [FM](../01_electricity/35_Frequency_Modulation_FM.md) Repeaters, Emergency Comms, Packet/APRS.
*   **Range:** Line of Sight (30-100 miles).
*   **DX:** Tropospheric Ducting (can go hundreds of miles), [SSB](../01_electricity/34_Single_Sideband_SSB.md)/[CW](../01_electricity/33_CW_Abbreviations_&_Prosigns.md) weak signal work.
*   **Antennas:** Very small (~1m / 3ft).

## 70cm Band (430 MHz)
*   **Primary Use:** Urban comms (penetrates buildings well), Satellite uplinks, Fast Scan TV.
*   **[Noise](../01_electricity/26_AC_Signals_&_Noise.md):** Lowest noise floor (S0).
*   **Range:** Strictly line of sight, but Tropospheric ducting can be very strong.
