# Map: Propagation Modes

This map covers the different paths radio waves take to travel from transmitter to receiver.

## Standard Modes
*   [Ground Wave Propagation](04_Ground_Wave_Propagation.md) - LF/MF, following the surface.
*   [Sky Wave Propagation](05_Sky_Wave_Propagation.md) - [HF](01_Propagation_Basics.md), skipping off the ionosphere.
*   [Line of Sight Propagation (LOS)](06_Line_of_Sight_Propagation_LOS.md) - [VHF](07_VHFUHF_Bands_6m,_2m,_70cm.md)/UHF, direct path.

## Extended VHF/UHF Modes
*   [Tropospheric Propagation](08_Tropospheric_Propagation.md) - Ducting and scattering due to weather.
*   [Exotic Propagation Modes](09_Exotic_Propagation_Modes.md) - Aurora, Meteor Scatter, EME.
