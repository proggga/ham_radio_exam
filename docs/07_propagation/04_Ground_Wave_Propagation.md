# Ground Wave Propagation (Grondgolf)

Ground wave propagation occurs when radio waves follow the curvature of the earth, hugging the surface.

## Components (Military Definition)
The term "Ground Wave" is often used broadly to include:
1.  **Surface Wave**: Follows the curvature of the earth. Affected by ground conductivity. (The primary meaning in Amateur Radio LF/MF contexts).
2.  **Direct Wave**: Line-of-Sight path.
3.  **Ground Reflected Wave**: Bounces off the ground to reach the receiver.
    *   *Note:* Direct and Reflected waves are often called "Space Waves" in amateur texts, distinct from the Surface Wave.

## Characteristics
*   **Frequency Range**: Dominant at Low Frequencies (LF), Medium Frequencies (MF), and lower [HF](01_Propagation_Basics.md) (160m/80m).
*   **Mechanism**: Diffraction and surface currents induced in the ground.
*   **Polarization**: **Vertical** polarization works best. Horizontal waves are shorted out by the conductive earth.

## Range
The range is determined by the earth's conductivity and frequency.
*   **Saltwater**: Excellent conductivity $\rightarrow$ Long range.
*   **Dry Sand/Rock**: Poor conductivity $\rightarrow$ Short range.
*   **Attenuation**: Increases rapidly with frequency. Above 3-5 MHz, ground wave range is negligible for DX.

### Practical Estimates (Military Handbook)
*   **Manpack Radio (Low Power)**: 20 - 30 km (12 - 22 miles).
*   **Vehicular/High Power**: 80 - 100 km.
*   **Terrain Factors**:
    *   *Desert/Dry Soil:* Reduces range significantly (1/5 to 1/3 of normal range).
    *   *Jungle/Vegetation:* Absorbs signals, reducing range.
    *   *Mountains:* Blocks path, though ground wave can diffract slightly over obstacles.
