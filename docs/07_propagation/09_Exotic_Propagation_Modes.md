# Exotic Propagation Modes

Specialized modes often used by weak-signal enthusiasts on [VHF](07_VHFUHF_Bands_6m,_2m,_70cm.md)/UHF.

## Types
*   **Aurora**: Reflection off ionized sheets at the magnetic poles during geomagnetic storms.
    *   *Effect*: Signals sound fluttery or "hissing". [CW](../01_electricity/33_CW_Abbreviations_&_Prosigns.md)/[SSB](../01_electricity/34_Single_Sideband_SSB.md) only (Voice is distorted).
*   **Meteor Scatter**: Reflection off short-lived ionized trails left by meteors burning up in the atmosphere.
    *   *Effect*: Short bursts ("pings") of signal. Used with digital modes like MSK144.
*   **EME (Earth-Moon-Earth)**: Bouncing signals off the moon.
    *   *Challenge*: Huge path loss (~250 [dB](../00_basic_skills.md)). Requires high power and large antennas.
