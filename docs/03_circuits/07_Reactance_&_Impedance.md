# Reactance & Impedance

This map covers AC circuit theory regarding resistance to current flow.

## Fundamentals
*   **Phase Relationships** - Lead and lag in L and C circuits.
*   **Reactance (Reactantie)** - Frequency dependent resistance (, X_C$).
*   **Impedance (Impedantie)** - Total opposition ($) and vector calculation.
