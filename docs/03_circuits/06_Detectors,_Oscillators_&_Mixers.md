# Detectors, Oscillators & Mixers

This map covers the key functional blocks of radio circuits (excluding amplifiers).

## Signal Generation
*   **Oscillators** - Creating AC signals (LC, Crystal).
*   **Phase Locked Loop (PLL)** - Synthesizing stable frequencies.

## Signal Processing
*   **Mixers** - Frequency conversion and Image frequency.
*   **Detectors (Demodulators) 202512292039** - Extracting audio (AM, SSB, FM).
