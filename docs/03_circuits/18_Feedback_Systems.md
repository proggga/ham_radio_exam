# Feedback Systems

Feedback is the process of taking part of the output signal and feeding it back to the input.

## Negative Feedback
Part of the output is **subtracted** from the input ($180^\circ$ out of phase).
*   **Effects**:
    *   Reduces Gain.
    *   **Reduces Distortion** (improves linearity).
    *   Increases [Bandwidth](07_Bandwidth.md).
    *   Increases Stability.
    *   Modifies Input/Output [Impedance](../01_electricity/21_Impedance_Impedantie.md).

## Positive Feedback
Part of the output is **added** to the input (in phase).
*   **Effects**:
    *   Increases Gain (Regenerative receiver).
    *   Reduces [Bandwidth](07_Bandwidth.md) (increases Q).
    *   **Oscillation**: If the loop gain is $\ge 1$, the circuit becomes an oscillator.
