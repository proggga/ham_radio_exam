# High-Performance Filters

For receiver selectivity (Intermediate Frequency stages), simple LC filters are often insufficient. Special mechanical or piezoelectric filters are used.

## Types
1.  **Crystal [Filter](03_Filters_&_Resonance.md)**: Uses quartz crystals.
    *   Very high $Q$, very steep edges (good shape factor).
    *   Used for [SSB](../01_electricity/34_Single_Sideband_SSB.md) (narrow) and [CW](../01_electricity/33_CW_Abbreviations_&_Prosigns.md) (very narrow) modes.
2.  **Mechanical [Filter](03_Filters_&_Resonance.md)**: Resonates mechanically (metal disks).
    *   High $Q$, distinctive flat top passband.
    *   Common in older high-quality receivers (Collins).
3.  **Ceramic [Filter](03_Filters_&_Resonance.md)**: Uses piezoelectric ceramics.
    *   Cheaper, medium performance.
    *   Common in broadcast radios and lower-cost transceivers.
    *   Often used for [FM](../01_electricity/35_Frequency_Modulation_FM.md) bandwidths.
