# Filters & Resonance

This map covers frequency selective circuits.

## Fundamentals
*   **Filter Types** - LPF, HPF, BPF, Notch.
*   **Resonance** - Series vs Parallel resonance ( = X_C$).

## Characteristics
*   **Quality Factor (Q)** - Q factor.
*   **Bandwidth** - -3dB bandwidth and selectivity.

## Advanced
*   **High-Performance Filters** - Crystal and Mechanical filters.
