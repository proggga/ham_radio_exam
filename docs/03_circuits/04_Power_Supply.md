# Power Supply

This map covers the conversion of mains power to useful DC for radio equipment.

## Stages
1.  **Rectification** - AC to pulsating DC (Diodes).
2.  **Power Supply Smoothing** - Pulsating DC to steady DC (Capacitors/Inductors).
3.  **Voltage Regulation** - Stabilizing the voltage (Zener/Linear/IC).

## Types
*   **Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS)** - High efficiency switching supplies (SMPS).
