# Dip Meter (Grid Dipper)

A Dip Meter is a variable oscillator with an external coil, used to find the resonant frequency of **unpowered** LC circuits.

## Operation
1.  Bring the Dip Meter's coil close to the circuit under test (loose coupling).
2.  Tune the Dip Meter frequency across the expected range.
3.  **[Resonance](../03_circuits/05_Resonance.md)**: When the Dip Meter matches the resonant frequency of the target circuit, the target absorbs energy.
4.  **The Dip**: This energy absorption causes the oscillator amplitude to drop, indicated by a "dip" on the meter needle.

## Uses
*   Measuring unknown Inductance ($L$) or Capacitance ($C$).
*   Tuning antennas and traps without a transmitter.
*   Determining the length of coaxial cables.
