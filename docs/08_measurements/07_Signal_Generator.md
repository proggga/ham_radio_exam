# Signal Generator

A Signal Generator produces stable RF signals for testing and aligning receivers.

## Features
*   **Precise Frequency**: Stable and adjustable.
*   **Accurate Attenuation**: Can output very low levels (e.g., $-100 dBm$ or microvolts) to test receiver sensitivity.
*   **[Modulation](../01_electricity/31_Modulation_&_Digital_Signals.md)**: Can add [AM](../01_electricity/32_Analogue_Modulation_&_AM.md), [FM](../01_electricity/35_Frequency_Modulation_FM.md), or [CW](../01_electricity/33_CW_Abbreviations_&_Prosigns.md) modulation to the carrier.
