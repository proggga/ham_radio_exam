What is amateur (ham) radio?
Amateur radio, also known as ham radio, is a hobby enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of Americans
and millions around the world. They enjoy communicating with one another via two-way radios and
experimenting with antennas and electronic circuits.
All kinds of people are amateur radio operators, also known as “hams.” Hams are young, old, men,
women, boys and girls. Kids as young as seven years old have gotten amateur radio licenses, and many
hams are active into their eighties and beyond. You never know who you'll run into on the amateur
radio bands: young and old, teachers and students, engineers and scientists, doctors and nurses,
mechanics and technicians, kings and entertainers.
For example, did you know that most of the astronauts sent up to the International Space Station (ISS)
in the last five to ten years have been licensed radio amateurs? They use the amateur radio station on
board the ISS to communicate with school groups all over the world as they are flying over.

How do you get into amateur radio?
With just a little study, you can learn all you need to know to get a Technician Class license, which is
the license class designed for beginners. To get a Technician Class license, you must take a test with 35
multiple-choice questions and answer 26 questions correctly. The test covers basic regulations, operating
practices, and electrical and electronics theory.
Knowing Morse Code is no longer required to get this license, nor any class of license. Technician Class
licensees have all amateur radio privileges above 30 MHz, including the very popular 2-meter band.
Technicians can also operate Morse Code (CW) on portions of the 80m, 40m, 15m, and 10m bands,
and voice and digital modes on portions of the 10m band.
There are two other license classes: the General Class license and the Amateur Extra Class license. To
get a General Class license, you must pass another 35-question test; the Amateur Extra Class test has 50
questions. The tests are progressively more difficult.
General Class licensees get phone and digital mode privileges on portions of the 160m, 80m, 60m,
40m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, and 10m bands. They can also operate CW and digital modes on the 30m
band. Amateur Extra licensees have all amateur privileges.

How much does it cost?
Basic study materials, such as this study guide, can be had for free, and the license exam fee will be $15
or less. Once you have your first license, most hams find it best to start with simple equipment and
grow over time. A handheld VHF FM transceiver can be purchased for less than $100 new, and
excellent used equipment is often available at low prices. All things considered, the cost to get the first
license and radio should be less than $200.

Where do I take the test?
Amateur radio license examinations are given by Volunteer Examiners, or VEs. VEs are licensed radio
amateurs who have been trained to administer amateur radio tests. To find out when the VEs in your
area will be giving the test, go to the American Radio Relay League's (ARRL) website:
http://www.arrl.org/find-an-amateur-radio-license-exam-session. Using that page, you will be able to
search for test sessions that are close to you. If you do not have access to the Internet, you can phone
the ARRL at 860-594-0200.

Can I really learn how to be an amateur radio operator from a study
guide like this?
Yes and no. This manual will help you get your license, but getting your license is only the beginning.
There is still much to learn, and to get the most out of amateur radio, you will have to continually learn
new things.
This study guide will teach you the answers to the test questions, but will not give you a deep
understanding of electronics, radio, or the rules and regulations. That will be up to you after you get
your license.
I hope that, by helping you get your license, this guide will encourage you to become an active radio
amateur and get on the air, participate in public service and emergency communications, join an
amateur radio club, and experiment with radios, antennas, and circuits. These are the activities that will
really help you learn about radio in depth, and in the end, help you be confident in your abilities as an
amateur radio operator.

How do I use this study guide?
First, read through the study guide and then take some practice tests. In this version of the study guide,
question and the correct answers are in bold-face type. The incorrect answers have been grayed out. You

Electrical principles
Units and terms: current, voltage, and resistance; alternating and direct
current; conductors and insulators
Figure 1 shows a simple electric circuit. It consists of a voltage source (in this case a battery, labeled V),
a resistor (labeled R), and some wires to connect the battery to the resistor. When connected in this
way, the voltage across the battery will cause a current (labeled I) to flow through the circuit. Voltage
(V), current (I), and resistance (R) are the three basic parameters of an electric circuit.

Figure 1. A simple electric circuit.

Voltage is the force that causes electrons to flow in a circuit. Voltage is measured in volts, and we use
the letter V to represent both the force and the units.
T5A05
What is the electrical term for the force that causes electron flow?
A. Voltage
B. Ampere-hours
C. Capacitance
D. Inductance
We sometimes call voltage electromotive force or electric potential and use the letter E to represent this
quantity. Both electromotive force and electric potential are measured in volts.

4

Current is the flow of electrons in a circuit. In Figure 1, the letter I stands for current. Current flows
from the positive (+) terminal of the voltage source through the circuit to the negative terminal of the
voltage source. Current is measured in amperes, and we use the letter A to stand for amperes.
T5A03
What is the name for the flow of electrons in an electric circuit?
A. Voltage
B. Resistance
C. Capacitance
D. Current
T5A01
Electrical current is measured in which of the following units?
A. Volts
B. Watts
C. Ohms
D. Amperes

Because the polarity of the battery voltage in the circuit never changes, the current will flow in only one
direction through the circuit. We call this direct current, or DC. Batteries supply direct current, or
simply, DC.
The type of current you get out of a wall socket is different from the current that you get from a battery.
We call it alternating current, or AC, because the voltage and current are constantly changing. Figure 2
shows how the voltage of an alternating current waveform changes with time. For this particular
waveform, the voltage starts at 0 V, increases to a positive peak voltage, then decreases to a negative
peak voltage, and then begins increasing again, until it once again reaches 0 V. When the voltage is
positive, the current flows in the positive direction, and when the voltage is negative the current flows
in the negative direction. This process repeats over and over.

Figure 2. An alternating current (AC) waveform.

5

T5A09
Which of the following describes alternating current?
A. Current that alternates between a positive direction and zero
B. Current that alternates between a negative direction and zero
C. Current that alternates between positive and negative directions
D. All these answers are correct
One of the most important parameters of an alternating current is its frequency. The frequency of an
alternating current is the number of times per second that an alternating current makes a complete
cycle, where a cycle is the portion of an alternating current waveform that repeats over and over. See
Figure 2.
The frequency of the alternating current that you get from a wall socket in your home is 60 cycles per
second, or in engineering terms, 60 hertz (Hz). 1 Hz is equal to one cycle per second.
T5A12
What describes the number of times per second that an alternating current makes a
complete cycle?
A. Pulse rate
B. Speed
C. Wavelength
D. Frequency
T5A06
What is the unit of frequency?
A. Hertz
B. Henry
C. Farad
D. Tesla
Resistance is the third basic parameter of an electric circuit. As the name implies, resistance opposes the
flow of current in a circuit. The higher the resistance, the smaller the current, for a given voltage. This
applies to direct current, alternating current, and RF current, which is alternating current with a high
frequency. We use the letter R to stand for resistance. Resistance is measured in ohms, and we use the
Greek letter omega (Ω) to stand for ohms.
T5A04
What are the units of electrical resistance?
A. Siemens
B. Mhos
C. Ohms
D. Coulombs
T5A11
What type of current flow is opposed by resistance?
A. Direct current
B. Alternating current
C. RF current
D. All these choices are correct
6

To connect components in an electric circuit, we generally use metal wires because they conduct
electrical current well or, in other words, have a low resistance. Metals generally are good conductors
because they have many free electrons, and as a result offer low resistance to current flow. Copper is
generally the conductor of choice for electronic cables and circuits because it offers good conductivity
and costs less than silver or gold.
T5A07
Why are metals generally good conductors of electricity?
A. They have relatively high density
B. They have many free electrons
C. They have many free protons
D. All these choices are correct
Many times we need a material that does not conduct current very well. We call these materials
insulators, and insulators have a high resistance. Plastics and glass are commonly used insulators.
T5A08
Which of the following is a good electrical insulator?
A. Copper
B. Glass
C. Aluminum
D. Mercury

Ohm’s Law: formulas and usage
Hams obey Ohm’s Law!
Ohm’s Law is the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. When
you know any two of these values, you can calculate the third.
The most basic equation for Ohm’s Law is E = I × R. In other words, when you know the current (I)
flowing through a circuit and the resistance (R) of the circuit, you can calculate the voltage (E) across
the circuit by multiplying these two values.
T5D02
What formula is used to calculate voltage in a circuit?
A. E = I x R
B. E = I / R
C. E = I + R
D. E = I - R
Using simple algebra, you can derive the other two forms of this equation: R = E / I and I = E / R.
These two equations let you calculate the resistance in a circuit if you know the voltage and current or
the current in a circuit if you know the voltage and resistance.
T5D03
What formula is used to calculate resistance in a circuit?
A. R = E x I
B. R = E / I
C. R = E + I
D. R = E – I
T5D01
What formula is used to calculate current in a circuit?
A. I = E  R
B. I = E / R
C. I = E + R
D. I = E - R
Now, let’s look at some examples of how to apply Ohm’s Law.
T5D04
What is the resistance of a circuit in which a current of 3 amperes flows when
connected to 90 volts?
A. 3 ohms
B. 30 ohms
C. 93 ohms
D. 270 ohms
Here’s how to calculate this answer: R = E / I = 90 volts / 3 amperes = 30 ohms.
8

T5D05
What is the resistance of a circuit for which the applied voltage is 12 volts and the
current flow is 1.5 amperes?
A. 18 ohms
B. 0.125 ohms
C. 8 ohms
D. 13.5 ohms
R = E / I = 12 volts / 1.5 amperes = 8 ohms.
T5D06
What is the resistance of a circuit that draws 4 amperes from a 12-volt source?
A. 3 ohms
B. 16 ohms
C. 48 ohms
D. 8 ohms
R = E / I = 12 volts / 4 amperes = 3 ohms.
Now, let's look at another form of the Ohm's Law equation, I = E / R to calculate the current in a
circuit.
T5D07
What is the current in a circuit with an applied voltage of 120 volts and a resistance of
80 ohms?
A. 9600 amperes
B. 200 amperes
C. 0.667 amperes
D. 1.5 amperes
I = E / R = 120 volts / 80 ohms = 1.5 amperes.
T5D08
What is the current through a 100-ohm resistor connected across 200 volts?
A. 20,000 amperes
B. 0.5 amperes
C. 2 amperes
D. 100 amperes
I = E / R = 200 volts / 100 ohms = 2 amperes.
T5D09
What is the current through a 24-ohm resistor connected across 240 volts?
A. 24,000 amperes
B. 0.1 amperes
C. 10 amperes
D. 216 amperes
I = E / R = 240 volts / 24 ohms = 10 amperes.

9

Now, let's look at the third form of the Ohm's Law equation, E = I × R to calculate the voltage across a
circuit.
T5D10
What is the voltage across a 2-ohm resistor if a current of 0.5 amperes flows through
it?
A. 1 volt
B. 0.25 volts
C. 2.5 volts
D. 1.5 volts
E = I × R = 0.5 amperes × 2 ohms = 1 volt.
T5D11
What is the voltage across a 10-ohm resistor if a current of 1 ampere flows through it?
A. 1 volt
B. 10 volts
C. 11 volts
D. 9 volts
E = I × R = 1 amperes × 10 ohms = 10 volts.
T5D12
What is the voltage across a 10-ohm resistor if a current of 2 amperes flows through it?
A. 8 volts
B. 0.2 volts
C. 12 volts
D. 20 volts
E = I × R = 2 amperes × 10 ohms = 20 volts.

10

Series and parallel circuits
Now, let’s consider circuits with two resistors instead of just a single resistor. There are two ways in
which the two resistors can be connected: in series or in parallel. Figure 3 shows a series circuit.

Figure 3. A series circuit.

The current I flows through both resistors because there is only one path for the current to flow. If
R1 = R2, then the voltage will be the same across both resistors, because the same current flows
through both resistors. If R1 does not equal R2, however, the voltages will be different. In either
case, the sum of the two voltages will equal the voltage of the voltage source.
T5D13
In which type of circuit is DC current the same through all components?
A. Series
B. Parallel
C. Resonant
D. Branch

11

In a parallel circuit, shown in Figure 4, both resistors are connected directly to the voltage source.

Figure 4. A parallel circuit.

Because both components are connected directly to the voltage source, the voltage across them will be
the same. This voltage will cause currents to flow in each of the resistors. I1 = E/R1, and I2 = E/R2. The
total current, I, is equal to I1 + I2. If R1 = R2, then the same current flows through both resistors. If
the resistors have different values, then I1 will be different from I2.
T5D14
In which type of circuit is voltage the same across all components?
A. Series
B. Parallel
C. Resonant
D. Branch

12

DC power
Power is the rate at which electrical energy is generated or used. Power is measured in watts. We use the
letter P to stand for power and the letter W to stand for watts.
T5A10
Which term describes the rate at which electrical energy is used?
A. Resistance
B. Current
C. Power
D. Voltage
T5A02
Electrical power is measured in which of the following units?
A. Volts
B. Watts
C. Watt-hours
D. Amperes
To calculate power, we multiply the voltage across a circuit by the current flowing through the circuit.
We write this equation P = E × I.
T5C08
What is the formula used to calculate electrical power (P) in a DC circuit?
A. P = E  I
B. P = E / I
C. P = E – I
D. P = E + I
Here are some examples:
T5C09
How much power is delivered by a voltage of 13.8 volts DC and a current of 10
amperes?
A. 138 watts
B. 0.7 watts
C. 23.8 watts
D. 3.8 watts
The calculation for this question is P = E × I = 13.8 V × 10 A = 138 W.
T5C10
How much power is delivered by a voltage of 12 volts DC and a current of 2.5
amperes?
A. 4.8 watts
B. 30 watts
C. 14.5 watts
D. 0.208 watts
The calculation for this question is P = E × I = 12 V × 2.5 A = 30 W.
Just as with Ohm’s Law, you can use algebra to come up with other forms of this equation to calculate
13

the voltage if you know the power and the current, or to calculate the current if you know the power
and the voltage. The formula to calculate the current, if you know the power and the voltage, is I = P /
E.
T5C11
How much current is required to deliver 120 watts at a voltage of 12 volts DC?
A. 0.1 amperes
B. 10 amperes
C. 12 amperes
D. 132 amperes
The calculation for this question is I = P / E = 120 W / 12 V = 10 A.

Math for electronics and conversion of electrical units
When dealing with electrical parameters such as voltage, resistance, current, and power, we use a set of
prefixes to denote various orders of magnitude:
•

milli- is the prefix used to denote 1 one-thousandth of a quantity. A milliampere, for example, is
1 one-thousandth of an ampere, or 0.001 A. Often, the letter m is used instead of the prefix
milli-. 1 milliampere is, therefore, 1 mA.

•

micro- is the prefix used to denote 1 one-millionth of a quantity. A microvolt, for example, is 1
one-millionth of a volt, or 0.000001 V. Often, you will see the Greek letter mu, or μ, used to
denote the prefix micro-. 1 microvolt is, therefore, 1 μV.

•

pico- is the prefix used to denote 1 one-trillionth of a quantity. A picovolt is 1 one-trillionth of
a volt, or 0.000001 μV.

•

kilo- is the prefix used to denote 1 thousand of a quantity. A kilovolt, for example, is 1000
volts. Often, the letter k is used instead of the prefix kilo-. 1 kilovolt is, therefore, 1 kV.

•

mega- is the prefix used to denote 1 million of a quantity. A megahertz, for example, is 1
million Hertz. Often, the letter M is used instead of the prefix mega-. 1 megahertz is, therefore,
1 MHz.

•

giga - is the prefix used to denote one billion of a quantity. One gigahertz, or 1 GHz, for
example is 1 billion Hertz.

18

Decibels
When dealing with ratios—especially power ratios—we often use decibels (dB). The reason for this is
that the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, meaning that we can talk about large ratios with relatively
small numbers. When the value is positive, it means that there is a power increase. When the value is
negative, it means that there is a power decrease.
At this point, you don’t need to know the formula used to calculate the ratio in dB, but you need to
know the ratios represented by the values 3 dB, 6 dB, and 10 dB.
T5B09
Which decibel value most closely represents a power increase from 5 watts to 10 watts?
A. 2 dB
B. 3 dB
C. 5 dB
D. 10 dB
3 dB corresponds to a ratio of 2 to 1, and because going from 5 watts to 10 watts doubles the power, we
can also say that there is a gain of 3 dB.
T5B10
Which decibel value most closely represents a power decrease from 12 watts to 3 watts?
A. -1 dB
B. -3 dB
C. -6 dB
D. -9 dB
6 dB corresponds to a ratio of 4 to 1, and a decrease in power from 12 watts to 3 watts is a ratio of 4 to
1. Because this is a power decrease, the value in dB is negative.
T5B11
Which decibel value represents a power increase from 20 watts to 200 watts?
A. 10 dB
B. 12 dB
C. 18 dB
D. 28 dB
Increasing the power from 20 watts to 200 watts is a ratio of 10 to 1, and 10 dB corresponds to a ratio
of 10 to 1.

Electronic components and circuits
Resistors
Resistors are components that, as the name implies, oppose the flow of current. We use them to control
how much current flows in a circuit. The higher the resistance, the lower the current.
Most resistors have a fixed value, specified in ohms, but some are designed to be variable. That is, you
can change the resistance by turning a shaft or sliding a control back and forth. Variable resistors, also
called potentiometers, are often used to allow users to adjust the way a device operates.
T6A01
What electrical component opposes the flow of current in a DC circuit?
A. Inductor
B. Resistor
C. Inverter
D. Transformer
T6A02
What type of component is often used as an adjustable volume control?
A. Fixed resistor
B. Power resistor
C. Potentiometer
D. Transformer
T6A03
What electrical parameter is controlled by a potentiometer?
A. Inductance
B. Resistance
C. Capacitance
D. Field strength

20

Capacitors
Another common electrical component is the capacitor. The most basic type of capacitor consists of two
metal plates separated by an insulator, called a dielectric. When you put a DC voltage across a
capacitor, an electric current flows into the capacitor until the voltage across the capacitor equals the
DC voltage. This puts a positive charge on one plate and a negative charge on the other, thereby
creating an electric field between the two plates.
T6A05
What type of electrical component consists of conductive surfaces separated by an
insulator?
A. Resistor
B. Potentiometer
C. Oscillator
D. Capacitor
T6A04
What electrical component stores energy in an electric field?
A. Varistor
B. Capacitor
C. Inductor
D. Diode
The capacitor stores energy in that electric field. The ability to store energy in an electric field is called
capacitance, and the unit of capacitance is called the farad.
T5C01
What describes the ability to store energy in an electric field?
A. Inductance

Diodes
Diodes are the most basic semiconductor component. They have only two electrodes, called the anode
and cathode, and conduct current only when it is forward biased. That is to say, diodes only conduct
current when the voltage on the anode is positive with respect to the cathode. When the diode is reverse
biased, i.e., when the voltage on the anode is negative with respect to the cathode, the diode will not
conduct current. To identify the cathode, it is often marked with a stripe.

When a diode is forward-biased, and a current flows through a diode, there is a voltage drop across the
diode called the forward voltage drop. The value of the forward voltage drop is lower in some diodes
than in others. For example, the forward voltage of a germanium diode is about 0.3 V, while the
forward voltage drop in a silicon diode is about 0.7 V.

Transistors
Transistors are semiconductor components designed to control the current flow through them. They
have three leads and one of those leads is used as the control pin. A current, in the case of the bipolar
junction transistor, or a voltage, in the case of the field effect transistor, on the control pin controls the
current flow between the two other pins.
In some circuits, the transistor is used as a switch, and the control signal simply switches the current on
and off. In other circuits, the transistor is used as an amplifier. When used as an amplifier, the current
through the transistor is proportional to the input current or voltage. The ratio of output current to
input current is called the gain of the transistor.

Bipolar junction transistors are transistors that consist of three regions of semiconductor material. These
regions are either P-type, which means that it has a positive net charge, or N-type, which means it has a
net negative charge. Each region has an electrode, making the transistor a device with three leads. The
names of these three electrodes are emitter, base and collector.
There are two types of bipolar junction transistors: PNP or NPN. A PNP transistor has two P layers,

Another type of transistor often found in amateur radio equipment is the field-effect transistor, or FET.
To control the flow of current through the field effect transistor, you use a voltage signal on the control
pin. This voltage sets up an electric field inside the transistor, hence the name field effect transistor.
FETs, like NPN and PNP transistors have three electrodes. These electrodes are called the gate, drain,
and source.

Resonant, or tuned, circuits
When a circuit has both inductors and capacitors, we sometimes call it a resonant, or tuned circuit. The
reason for this is that these circuits have a resonant frequency. When a capacitor and inductor are

Other components
There are many different types of components in modern radio equipment. Below, we will describe the
types of components you will need to know about to pass the Technician Class license examination.
Switches are used to open and close circuits or to switch an input or output between two or more

Power supplies generally have one or more fuses. An output fuse, for example, will prevent a device
connected to the power supply from drawing so much current from the supply that it damages the
supply. We call this situation a current overload. The output fuse protects the power supply from
damage by breaking the connection between the power supply and the device being powered when the
current rises above a certain value.

34

Radio wave characteristics
Frequency, wavelength, and the electromagnetic spectrum
Radio waves are what amateur radio is all about. Amateur radio operators generate them and send them
off into space. Then, we capture them and demodulate them.
Radio waves are also called electromagnetic waves because they consist of both an electric field and a
magnetic field. The two fields are at right angles to one another as they travel through space.
T3B03
What are the two components of a radio wave?
A. Impedance and reactance
B. Voltage and current
C. Electric and magnetic fields
D. Ionizing and non-ionizing radiation
T3B01
What is the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic
wave?
A. They travel at different speeds
B. They are in parallel
C. They revolve in opposite directions
D. They are at right angles
All electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, travel at the speed of light, or 300 million meters per
second.
T3B04
What is the velocity of a radio wave traveling through free space?
A. Speed of light
B. Speed of sound
C. Speed inversely proportional to its wavelength
D. Speed that increases as the frequency increases
T3B11
What is the approximate velocity of a radio wave in free space?
A. 150,000 meters per second
B. 300,000,000 meters per second
C. 300,000,000 miles per hour
D. 150,000 miles per hour
An important characteristic of a radio wave is its frequency, or the number of cycles per second. As
mentioned earlier, the unit of frequency is the Hertz. We abbreviate Hertz as Hz, and one Hz is one
cycle per second.
A characteristic of a radio wave that is related to frequency is its wavelength. A wavelength is the
distance that a radio wave travels during one cycle. Because radio waves travel at the speed of light, or
300,000,000 meters per second, the wavelength is 300,000,000 divided by the frequency. To make this
35

easier to calculate, you can divide both the speed of light and the frequency by one million. That makes
the equation:
wavelength (m) = 300/f (MHz)
The converse of this equation is:
f (MHz) = 300/wavelength (m)
As you can see from the equations, the lower the frequency, the longer the wavelength, and vice versa,
the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength.
T3B06
What is the formula for converting frequency to approximate wavelength in meters?
A. Wavelength in meters equals frequency in hertz multiplied by 300
B. Wavelength in meters equals frequency in hertz divided by 300
C. Wavelength in meters equals frequency in megahertz divided by 300
D. Wavelength in meters equals 300 divided by frequency in megahertz
T3B05
What is the relationship between wavelength and frequency?
A. Wavelength gets longer as frequency increases
B. Wavelength gets shorter as frequency increases
C. Wavelength and frequency are unrelated
D. Wavelength and frequency increase as path length increases
In amateur radio, we sometimes use the frequency and sometimes the wavelength when talking about a
radio signal. We use wavelength, for example, when we refer to the amateur radio bands. The 2 m
amateur radio band, for example, spans 144 MHz to 148 MHz. A radio wave with a frequency of 148
MHz, would have a wavelength of 2.03 meters.
T3B07
In addition to frequency, which of the following is used to identify amateur radio
bands?

frequency (HF), very high frequency (VHF), and ultra high frequency (UHF).

A. 30 to 300 kHz
B. 30 to 300 MHz
C. 300 to 3000 kHz
D. 300 to 3000 MHz
A radio signal of any frequency is called a radio frequency, or RF, signal.
T5C06
What does the abbreviation “RF” mean?
A. Radio frequency signals of all types
B. The resonant frequency of a tuned circuit
C. The real frequency transmitted as opposed to the apparent frequency
D. Reflective force in antenna transmission lines

37

Propagation modes
As amateur radio operators, we should always try to use the right frequency and the right mode when
communicating. To do this, we need to know how radio signals travel from one point to another and
what effect frequency, our antennas and even our location have on signal propagation.
Communications at VHF and UHF frequencies are generally “line-of-sight” communications. This
means they normally travel in a straight line from the transmitter to the receiver. For this reason, they
are normally used for local communications.
Because VHF and UHF signals are line-of-sight, at some distance, the signals will be blocked by the
curvature of the Earth. The maximum distance for line-of-sight communications is called the radio
horizon. The radio horizon extends somewhat farther than the visual horizon.
T3C11
Why is the radio horizon for VHF and UHF signals more distant than the visual
horizon?
A. Radio signals move somewhat faster than the speed of light
B. Radio waves are not blocked by dust particles
C. The atmosphere refracts radio waves slightly
D. Radio waves are blocked by dust particles
T3C01
Why are simplex UHF signals rarely heard beyond their radio horizon?
A. They are too weak to go very far
B. FCC regulations prohibit them from going more than 50 miles
C. UHF signals are usually not propagated by the ionosphere
D. UHF signals are absorbed by the ionospheric D region
Some signals bounce off the ionosphere. This gives them the ability to travel much further than line of
sight. We’ll talk more about the ionosphere later.

One problem often encountered when using VHF and UHF frequencies is multipath propagation.
Multipath propagation occurs when your signals arrive at a receiving station via two or more paths.
Since the signal paths may be different lengths, the signals may arrive out of phase and cancel one
another or arrive in phase and reinforce one another. Moving an antenna only a few feet, say when
you’re operating mobile, can cause the received signal strength to vary greatly.
T3A01
Why do VHF signal strengths sometimes vary greatly when the antenna is moved only
a few feet?
A. The signal path encounters different concentrations of water vapor
B. VHF ionospheric propagation is very sensitive to path length
C. Multipath propagation cancels or reinforces signals
D. All these choices are correct
This can be a real problem for mobile operation, as your transmitter and antenna location is constantly
38

changing. This means that the signal strength at the receiving station constantly changes as well. This
rapid fluctuation in received signal strength is sometimes called picket fencing.
T3A06
What is the meaning of the term “picket fencing”?
A. Alternating transmissions during a net operation
B. Rapid flutter on mobile signals due to multipath propagation
C. A type of ground system used with vertical antennas
D. Local vs long-distance communications
Because it can cause signal strength to vary greatly, multipath propagation affects both voice and digital
transmissions. Since reliable digital transmissions rely on the signals being relatively constant and
strong, multipath propagation can cause errors to occur.
T3A10
What effect does multipath propagation have on data transmissions?
A. Transmission rates must be increased by a factor equal to the number of separate paths
observed
B. Transmission rates must be decreased by a factor equal to the number of separate paths
observed
C. No significant changes will occur if the signals are transmitted using FM
D. Error rates are likely to increase

Knowing how VHF and UHF signals propagate can help you communicate even in adverse conditions.
When trying to use a repeater, for example, you may find yourself in a place where a direct path to the
repeater is not possible. If you find yourself in this situation, you could try using a directional antenna
and bounce your signal off buildings or other obstructions.
T3A05
When using a directional antenna, how might your station be able to communicate
with a distant repeater if buildings or obstructions are blocking the direct line of sight
path?
A. Change from vertical to horizontal polarization
B. Try to find a path that reflects signals to the repeater
C. Try the long path
D. Increase the antenna SWR
Another phenomenon you might use when a direct path to a repeater is not possible is “knife-edge”
diffraction. You might be able to use this phenomenon to get your signal around a building in an urban
setting or over a mountain peak in an outside setting.
T3C05
Which of the following effects may allow radio signals to travel beyond obstructions
between the transmitting and receiving stations?
A. Knife-edge diffraction
B. Faraday rotation
C. Quantum tunneling
D. Doppler shift
39

A condition that could impede the transmission of UHF and microwave signals is heavy vegetation. So,
keep your antennas out of trees or above trees.
T3A02
What is the effect of vegetation on UHF and microwave signals?
A. Knife-edge diffraction
B. Absorption
C. Amplification
D. Polarization rotation

40

Antenna polarization
Antenna polarization is important at VHF and UHF frequencies. How you mount an antenna directly
affects its polarization. When the radiating element of an antenna is vertical, the electric field will be
vertically polarized, and we say that the transmitted radio waves have a vertical polarization. When the
radiating element of an antenna is horizontal, the electric field will be horizontally polarized, and we say
that the radio waves have a horizontal polarization.
T3B02
What property of a radio wave defines its polarization?
A. The orientation of the electric field
B. The orientation of the magnetic field
C. The ratio of the energy in the magnetic field to the energy in the electric field
D. The ratio of the velocity to the wavelength
T3A04
What happens when antennas at opposite ends of a VHF or UHF line of sight radio
link are not using the same polarization?
A. The modulation sidebands might become inverted
B. Received signal strength is reduced
C. Signals have an echo effect
D. Nothing significant will happen
When using a repeater, vertical polarization is most often used. So, when using a handheld transceiver,
make sure to hold it so that your antenna is straight up and down. Different activities use different
antenna polarizations, though.
T3A03
What antenna polarization is normally used for long-distance CW and SSB contacts
on the VHF and UHF bands?
A. Right-hand circular
B. Left-hand circular
C. Horizontal
D. Vertical
The reason for this is that operators transmitting CW and SSB signals are often using what are called
beam antennas, and it’s much easier to mount and operate beam antennas horizontally than it is to
mount them vertically.

Interesting propagation phenomena
Even though VHF communications are most often line-of-sight, there are some propagation modes
that make it possible to communicate over long distances. For example, sometimes VHF signals will
bounce off the E layer of the ionosphere. This phenomenon is called “sporadic E” propagation because
it happens only sporadically.
T3C04
41

Which of the following types of propagation is most commonly associated with
occasional strong signals on the 10, 6, and 2 meter bands from beyond the radio
horizon?
A. Backscatter
B. Sporadic E
C. D region absorption
D. Gray-line propagation
Other interesting propagation phenomena at VHF frequencies include auroral backscatter, meteor
scatter, tropospheric scatter, and tropospheric ducting. Bouncing signals off the earth’s aurora is very
interesting to do, but the signals usually become distorted and signal strength can vary greatly. This is
because the aurora itself is constantly changing.
T3C03
What is a characteristic of VHF signals received via auroral backscatter?
A. They are often received from 10,000 miles or more
B. They are distorted and signal strength varies considerably
C. They occur only during winter nighttime hours
D. They are generally strongest when your antenna is aimed west
Some hams also bounce signals off meteor showers. This propagation mode is called meteor scatter.
Meteor scatter propagation is most pronounced on the 6-meter band.
T3C07
What band is best suited for communicating via meteor scatter?
A. 33 centimeters
B. 6 meters
C. 2 meters
D. 70 centimeters
One question that I often get is whether or not the weather affects radio wave propagation. The short
answer is no, but there are, of course, exceptions to this rule. One way that weather can affect radio
propagation is when there is a temperature inversion in the atmosphere. A temperature inversion occurs
when a layer of cooler air gets trapped below a layer of warmer air in the troposphere. The troposphere
is the lowest region of the atmosphere, extending from the earth’s surface to a height of about 6–10 km.
When this happens, a tropospheric duct may form. VHF signals entering this duct may propagate
through the duct for hundreds of miles.
T3C06
What type of propagation is responsible for allowing over-the-horizon VHF and UHF
communications to ranges of approximately 300 miles on a regular basis?
A. Tropospheric ducting
B. D region refraction
C. F2 region refraction
D. Faraday rotation
T3C08
What causes tropospheric ducting?
A. Discharges of lightning during electrical storms
42

B. Sunspots and solar flares
C. Updrafts from hurricanes and tornadoes
D. Temperature inversions in the atmosphere
Another exception to the rule occurs at microwave frequencies. Precipitation, including rain, snow, or
ice can absorb microwave signals, thereby decreasing range.
T3A07
What weather condition might decrease range at microwave frequencies?
A. High winds
B. Low barometric pressure
C. Precipitation
D. Colder temperatures
At lower frequencies, however, precipitation has little or no effect on propagation.
T3A12
What is the effect of fog and rain on signals in the 10 meter and 6 meter bands?
A. Absorption
B. There is little effect
C. Deflection
D. Range increase

43

HF propagation
For reliable long-distance communications, amateurs use the HF frequencies. The reason for this is that
HF signals bounce off the ionosphere. This phenomenon allows amateur radio operators to contact
other amateur radio stations around the world.
The ionosphere is created by solar radiation, which creates a high concentration of ions and free
electrons that reflect radio waves. It extends from about 50 to 600 miles above the earth’s surface. There
are three ionospheric layers—the D, E, and F layers—with the D layer being closest to the Earth, and
the F layer being the layer farthest from the surface of the Earth.
T3A11
Which region of the atmosphere can refract or bend HF and VHF radio waves?
A. The stratosphere
B. The troposphere
C. The ionosphere
D. The mesosphere
T3C02
What is a characteristic of HF communication compared with communications on
VHF and higher frequencies?
A. HF antennas are generally smaller
B. HF accommodates wider bandwidth signals
C. Long-distance ionospheric propagation is far more common on HF
D. There is less atmospheric interference (static) on HF
One interesting phenomenon that is related to HF propagation is the sunspot cycle. Generally, the
number of sunspots increases and decreases over an 11-year cycle, and HF propagation, especially on
the higher frequency HF bands, is best at times when there are many sunspots. The reason for this is
that the more sunspots there are, the more solar radiation reaches earth. This radiation increases the
amount of ionization in the ionosphere, which in turn, increases the ability of the ionosphere to reflect
radio waves.
T3C10
Which of the following bands may provide long-distance communications via the
ionosphere’s F region during the peak of the sunspot cycle?
A. 6 and 10 meters
B. 23 centimeters
C. 70 centimeters and 1.25 meters
D. All these choices are correct
Because of the way that the ionosphere changes throughout the day, propagation is best on the higher
frequency bands (10m, 15m and 20m) during the day, while propagation is best on the lower frequency
bands (160m, 80m, 40m) at night.
T3C09
What is generally the best time for long-distance 10 meter band propagation via the F
region?
A. From dawn to shortly after sunset during periods of high sunspot activity
44

B. From shortly after sunset to dawn during periods of high sunspot activity
C. From dawn to shortly after sunset during periods of low sunspot activity
D. From shortly after sunset to dawn during periods of low sunspot activity

A common phenomenon of HF signal propagation is fading.
T3A08
What is a likely cause of irregular fading of signals propagated by the ionosphere?
A. Frequency shift due to Faraday rotation
B. Interference from thunderstorms
C. Intermodulation distortion
D. Random combining of signals arriving via different paths
This is similar to multipath distortion of VHF and UHF signals, but in this case, the signals are
bouncing off the ionosphere, and because the ionosphere is constantly changing, signals fade in and out.

Antenna polarization is not as important when operating on the HF bands as it is when operating on
the VHF/UHF bands. This is because signals “skip” off the ionosphere and become neither horizontally
polarized, nor vertically polarized, but elliptically polarized.
T3A09
Which of the following results from the fact that signals propagated by the ionosphere
are elliptically polarized?
A. Digital modes are unusable
B. Either vertically or horizontally polarized antennas may be used for transmission or
reception
C. FM voice is unusable
D. Both the transmitting and receiving antennas must be of the same polarization

Antennas and feed lines
Antenna types
The most common, and perhaps the simplest, antenna is the half-wave dipole antenna. As the name
suggests, it measures close to one half wavelength from one end of the antenna to the other. Because
half-wave dipole antennas can be quite long—a 40m half-wave dipole antenna, for example, is about 66
feet long—they are normally mounted horizontally between two vertical supports.
T9A03
Which of the following describes a simple dipole oriented parallel to Earth's surface?
A. A ground-wave antenna
B. A horizontally polarized antenna
C. A travelling-wave antenna
D. A vertically polarized antenna
When putting up a dipole antenna, you should consider the orientation of the antenna because it
radiates better broadside to the antenna than off the ends of the antenna.
T9A10
In which direction does a half-wave dipole antenna radiate the strongest signal?
A. Equally in all directions
B. Off the ends of the antenna
C. In the direction of the feed line
D. Broadside to the antenna
So, for example, if you live in Kansas, you might want to orient the antenna so that the wire runs north
to south. The antenna will then radiate best east and west, meaning that you’ll be able to cover most of
the U.S.
The length of a dipole antenna is actually about 5% shorter than the value that you would calculate
using the formula wavelength (m) = 300 / frequency (MHz). The reason for this is that there will be
some stray capacitance between the wire and the ground and other objects near the antenna. Let’s take a
look at an example.
T9A09
What is the approximate length, in inches, of a half-wavelength 6 meter dipole
antenna?
A. 6
B. 50
C. 112
D. 236
Here’s how to make this calculation. One half wavelength is 3 m. 3 m x 39.4 in/m = 118.2 inches.
Since the length of the antenna is about 5% shorter than this calculated value, the approximate length
of the antenna will be 118.2 inches x 0.95, or about 112 inches.
Once you have built a dipole antenna, chances are it won't be resonant on the frequency you want. To
46

tune the antenna, you need to determine its resonant frequency and then make it longer or shorter. To
decrease the resonant frequency of an antenna, you lengthen it, because the wavelength is longer.
Conversely, to increase the resonant frequency, you shorten the antenna.
T9A05
Which of the following increases the resonant frequency of a dipole antenna?
A. Lengthening it
B. Inserting coils in series with radiating wires
C. Shortening it
D. Adding capacitive loading to the ends of the radiating wires
The final length will depend on the height at which you mount the antenna and any trees or buildings
that are nearby.

Perhaps the second-most popular type of amateur radio antenna is the quarter-wave vertical antenna.
The radiator of a vertical antenna is mounted perpendicular to the Earth. This makes it verticallypolarized, because the electric field will have the same orientation as the antenna’s radiator.
Like the half-wave dipole antenna, the length of a quarter-wave vertical antenna will be about 5%
shorter than the calculated quarter wavelength.
T9A08
What is the approximate length, in inches, of a quarter-wavelength vertical antenna
for 146 MHz?
A. 112
B. 50
C. 19
D. 12
The wavelength of a 146 MHz radio wave is approximately 2 m. One quarter of a wavelength is
therefore 0.5 m. 0.5 m x 39.4 in/m = 19.7 in. 19.7 in x 0.95 ≈ 19 in.

Because full-size, half-wave or quarter-wave HF antennas can be very long, many amateurs use a
technique called “loading” to shorten them. You can use either inductors or capacitors to load an
antenna, but the most common way is to use an inductor. In either case, loading an antenna makes it
seem electrically longer to a signal at the antenna feed point.
T9A02
Which of the following describes a type of antenna loading?
A. Electrically lengthening by inserting inductors in radiating elements
B. Inserting a resistor in the radiating portion of the antenna to make it resonant
C. Installing a spring in the base of a mobile vertical antenna to make it more flexible
D. Strengthening the radiating elements of a beam antenna to better resist wind damage
While this technique does allow you to shorten an antenna, the shortened antenna will not be as
efficient as a full-size antenna.
47

Many amateurs use directional or beam antennas. Beam antennas concentrate the power that is applied
to them in one direction, thereby increasing the signal strength in that direction, when compared to a
reference antenna, such as a dipole antenna. We call this increase in signal strength antenna gain. There
are many different types of beam antennas, including the Yagi, the quad, and the dish antenna.
T9A01
What is a beam antenna?
A. An antenna built from aluminum I-beams
B. An omnidirectional antenna invented by Clarence Beam
C. An antenna that concentrates signals in one direction
D. An antenna that reverses the phase of received signals
T9A11
What is antenna gain?
A. The additional power that is added to the transmitter power
B. The additional power that is required in the antenna when transmitting on a higher
frequency
C. The increase in signal strength in a specified direction compared to a reference
antenna
D. The increase in impedance on receive or transmit compared to a reference antenna
T9A06
Which of the following types of antenna offers the greatest gain?
A. 5/8 wave vertical
B. Isotropic
C. J pole
D. Yagi

Most handheld VHF and UHF transceivers come with short, flexible antennas called “rubber duck”
antennas. These antennas use inductive loading to make them shorter than a full-sized antenna. Loading
them like this makes them less efficient than a full-sized quarter-wavelength vertical antenna.
T9A04
What is a disadvantage of the short, flexible antenna supplied with most handheld
radio transceivers, compared to a full-sized quarter-wave antenna?
A. It has low efficiency
B. It transmits only circularly polarized signals
C. It is mechanically fragile
D. All these choices are correct
This disadvantage is compounded if you try to use a handheld VHF transceiver inside a vehicle. The
shielding effect of the vehicle’s metal frame will prevent some of your signal from getting outside the
vehicle and block some of the signal from a repeater or other station from reaching the antenna inside
the vehicle.
T9A07
48

What is a disadvantage of using a handheld VHF transceiver with a flexible antenna
inside a vehicle?
A. Signal strength is reduced due to the shielding effect of the vehicle
B. The bandwidth of the antenna will decrease, increasing SWR
C. The SWR might decrease, decreasing the signal strength
D. All these choices are correct
A better option is to use an externally-mounted antenna. A popular choice for an externally-mounted
mobile antenna is the 5/8-wavelength vertical antenna. One reason that it is a popular choice, is that it
has more gain than a 1/4-wavelength antenna.
T9A12
What is an advantage of a 5/8 wavelength whip antenna for VHF or UHF mobile
service?
A. It has more gain than a 1/4-wavelength antenna
B. It radiates at a very high angle
C. It eliminates distortion caused by reflected signals
D. It has 10 times the power gain of a 1/4 wavelength whip

49

Feed lines and connectors
Feed lines connect radios to antennas. There are many different types of feed lines, including coaxial
cable, ladder line, twin lead, and open-wire feed line, but coaxial cable is the most common type.
T9B03
Why is coaxial cable the most common feed line for amateur radio antenna systems?
A. It is easy to use and requires few special installation considerations
B. It has less loss than any other type of feed line
C. It can handle more power than any other type of feed line
D. It is less expensive than any other type of feed line

Perhaps the most important consideration when choosing a feed line is the impedance of the feed line.
In general, you should match the impedance of the feed line to the output impedance of the transmitter
and the input impedance of the antenna.
T5C12
What is impedance?
A. The opposition to AC current flow
B. The inverse of resistance
C. The Q or Quality Factor of a component
D. The power handling capability of a component
T5C05
What is the unit of impedance?
A. The volt
B. The ampere
C. The coulomb
D. The ohm
Most amateur radio transmitters have an output impedance of 50 ohms, and most antennas have an
input impedance close to 50 ohms. Because this is the case, most coaxial cable used in amateur radio
stations has an impedance of 50 ohms.
T9B02
What is the most common impedance of coaxial cables used in amateur radio?
A. 8 ohms
B. 50 ohms
C. 600 ohms
D. 12 ohms
RG-58 and RG-213 are two types of coaxial cable often used in amateur radio stations. Both have an
impedance of 50 ohms.

Despite being the most popular type of feedline for amateur radio stations, coaxial cable does have some
disadvantages. One of them is that it may be lossy at high frequencies. Some coax cable types have more

50

loss than others.
T9B05
What happens as the frequency of a signal in coaxial cable is increased?
A. The characteristic impedance decreases
B. The loss decreases
C. The characteristic impedance increases
D. The loss increases
T9B10
What is the electrical difference between RG-58 and RG-213 coaxial cable?
A. There is no significant difference between the two types
B. RG-58 cable has two shields
C. RG-213 cable has less loss at a given frequency
D. RG-58 cable can handle higher power levels
What this means in practice is that using RG-58 coax as the feed line for an 80 m dipole might be just
fine, but you don’t want to use 50 feet of RG-58 to connect your 440 MHz FM transceiver to an
antenna on your roof or on a tower.
Even RG-213 coaxial cable is not really the best choice for use at VHF and UHF frequencies. Most
repeaters, for example, use air-insulated hard line coaxial cable for the feed line.
T9B11
Which of the following types of feed line has the lowest loss at VHF and UHF?
A. 50-ohm flexible coax
B. Multi-conductor unbalanced cable
C. Air-insulated hardline
D. 75-ohm flexible coax
Many other factors, including water intrusion, high SWR, and multiple connectors in line can cause
losses in a coaxial feed line.
T9B08
Which of the following is a source of loss in coaxial feed line?
A. Water intrusion into coaxial connectors
B. High SWR
C. Multiple connectors in the line
D. All these choices are correct

Moisture contamination not only causes higher feed line losses. If not addressed, it can also cause
coaxial cables to fail.
T7C09
Which of the following causes failure of coaxial cables?
A. Moisture contamination
B. Solder flux contamination
C. Rapid fluctuation in transmitter output power
D. Operation at 100% duty cycle for an extended period
51

One way that moisture enters a cable is via cracks in the cable’s outer jacket caused by ultraviolet light.
T7C10
Why should the outer jacket of coaxial cable be resistant to ultraviolet light?
A. Ultraviolet resistant jackets prevent harmonic radiation
B. Ultraviolet light can increase losses in the cable’s jacket
C. Ultraviolet and RF signals can mix, causing interference
D. Ultraviolet light can damage the jacket and allow water to enter the cable
Air-insulated hard line is also susceptible to moisture problems.
T7C11
What is a disadvantage of air core coaxial cable when compared to foam or solid
dielectric types?
A. It has more loss per foot
B. It cannot be used for VHF or UHF antennas
C. It requires special techniques to prevent moisture in the cable
D. It cannot be used at below freezing temperatures

PL-259 connectors are the most common type of connectors used on coaxial cables in amateur radio
stations.
T9B07
Which of the following is true of PL-259 type coax connectors?
A. They are preferred for microwave operation
B. They are watertight
C. They are commonly used at HF and VHF frequencies
D. They are a bayonet-type connector
One problem with PL-259 connectors is that they are not the most suitable connector when operating
at higher frequencies. Even though PL-259 connectors are called UHF connectors, Type N connectors
are a much better choice for UHF frequencies.
T9B06
Which of the following RF connector types is most suitable for frequencies above 400
MHz?
A. UHF (PL-259/SO-239)
B. Type N
C. RS-213
D. DB-25

Coaxial cable connectors can be a real pain to install properly and are a frequent cause of failure. When
installing a feed line, make sure that your coaxial connectors are crimped or soldered properly and that
they make solid connections with one another.
T9B09
What can cause erratic changes in SWR?
52

A. Local thunderstorm
B. Loose connection in the antenna or feed line
C. Over-modulation
D. Overload from a strong local station

53

Standing wave ratio and antenna measurements
Standing wave ratio, or SWR, is a term you’ll often hear when talking about antennas and feed lines. It
is a measure of how well a load, such as an antenna, is matched to a transmission line. When we say
that an antenna is matched to a transmission line, we mean that the impedance of the transmission line
is equal to the impedance of the antenna. If you measure the SWR of a perfectly-matched antenna
system, the SWR meter will read 1:1. The higher the SWR reading, the greater the mismatch between
the antenna and the transmission line.
T9B12
What is standing wave ratio (SWR)?
A. A measure of how well a load is matched to a transmission line
B. The ratio of amplifier power output to input
C. The transmitter efficiency ratio
D. An indication of the quality of your station’s ground connection
T7C04
What reading on an SWR meter indicates a perfect impedance match between the
antenna and the feed line?
A. 50:50
B. Zero
C. 1:1
D. Full Scale
T7C06
What does an SWR reading of 4:1 indicate?
A. Loss of -4 dB
B. Good impedance match
C. Gain of +4 dB
D. Impedance mismatch
When the feed line impedance matches the antenna input impedance, the SWR will be low. Low SWR
on a coaxial cable feed line is a good thing because when the feed line impedance matches the antenna
input impedance, signal losses are low, meaning that the antenna will radiate more power.
T9B01
What is a benefit of low SWR?
A. Reduced television interference
B. Reduced signal loss
C. Less antenna wear
D. All these choices are correct
The bigger the mismatch is between the feed line and the load, the higher the SWR will be. The higher
the SWR, the more power is lost in the feed line. Power converted into heat is not radiated by the
antenna, meaning your radiated signal will be weaker.
T7C07
What happens to power lost in a feed line?
A. It increases the SWR
54

B. It is radiated as harmonics
C. It is converted into heat
D. It distorts the signal

Most amateur radio transceivers today will reduce output power if the antenna system SWR is high.
The reason for this is to protect the radio from being damaged by reflected power.
T7C05
Why do most solid-state transmitters reduce output power as SWR increases beyond a
certain level?
A. To protect the output amplifier transistors
B. To comply with FCC rules on spectral purity
C. Because power supplies cannot supply enough current at high SWR
D. To lower the SWR on the transmission line

When choosing an SWR meter, be sure to note the frequency range over which the meter will operate
and the maximum power level at which you can use the meter. Using a meter outside of the specified
range can result in erroneous readings, and using a meter above the maximum power level can damage
the meter.
T4A02
Which of the following should be considered when selecting an accessory SWR meter?
A. The frequency and power level at which the measurements will be made
B. The distance that the meter will be located from the antenna
C. The types of modulation being used at the station
D. All these choices are correct
An SWR meter is not the only way to measure SWR. You can also measure SWR with a directional
wattmeter.
T7C08
Which instrument can be used to determine SWR?
A. Voltmeter
B. Ohmmeter
C. Iambic pentameter
D. Directional wattmeter
When using a directional wattmeter, you first measure the forward power, then the reflected power, and
using those two values, calculate the SWR. Since the wattmeter measures power, you should install it in
the feedline, between the transmitter and antenna.
T4A05
Where should an RF power meter be installed?
A. In the feed line, between the transmitter and antenna
B. At the power supply output
C. In parallel with the push-to-talk line and the antenna
D. In the power supply cable, as close as possible to the radio
55

Another test instrument that you can use to measure the SWR of an antenna system is the antenna
analyzer. The SWR of an antenna system will be 1:1 at the resonant frequency.
T7C02
Which of the following is used to determine if an antenna is resonant at the desired
operating frequency?
A. A VTVM
B. An antenna analyzer
C. A Q meter
D. A frequency counter
Some antenna analyzers will also let you measure capacitive reactance and inductive reactance, and also
be used as an RF signal generator. These capabilities may be useful in applications other than antenna
analysis.

If an antenna's impedance is not 50 ohms, the impedance at the transmitter end of a feed line will not
be 50 ohms. Don't worry, though. You can use a device called an antenna tuner or antenna coupler to
transform the impedance from whatever it happens to be to 50 ohms. We call this process impedance
matching.
T9B04
What is the major function of an antenna tuner (antenna coupler)?
A. It matches the antenna system impedance to the transceiver's output impedance
B. It helps a receiver automatically tune in weak stations
C. It allows an antenna to be used on both transmit and receive
D. It automatically selects the proper antenna for the frequency band being used

In addition to instruments that make antenna measurements, it's helpful to have an instrument that can
simulate an antenna. That's the purpose of a dummy load. Basically, a dummy load is just a big 50-ohm
resistor that provides a known impedance to the transmitter and converts the transmitter output power
into heat so that it does not get radiated. If a transmitter operates normally when a dummy load is
connected to it, you can be reasonably sure that your transmitter is working properly.
T7C01
What is the primary purpose of a dummy load?
A. To prevent transmitting signals over the air when making tests
B. To prevent over-modulation of a transmitter
C. To improve the efficiency of an antenna
D. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of a receiver
T7C03 (B)
What does a dummy load consist of?
A. A high-gain amplifier and a TR switch
B. A non-inductive resistor mounted on a heat sink
C. A low-voltage power supply and a DC relay
D. A 50-ohm reactance used to terminate a transmission line
56

Amateur radio signals
Modulation modes and signal bandwidth
Modulation is the process of adding information to a radio wave. For example, to send a voice signal,
you modulate the radio wave with your voice. There are several different types of modulation, but when
you get your Technician license, chances are that frequency modulation (FM) or phase modulation
(PM), is the type of modulation that you’ll use first. When you frequency modulate or phase modulate
a radio signal, the audio actually changes the frequency of the signal a little in proportion to the volume
of the audio signal. An FM receiver detects this frequency change and recreates the audio.
T8A04
Which type of modulation is commonly used for VHF and UHF voice repeaters?
A. AM
B. SSB
C. PSK
D. FM or PM
Packet radio is a way to send digital information over the air. On VHF, this is usually done using an
FM or PM signal. The digital information is sent by changing the frequency of the audio. For example,
a VHF packet radio transmission with a data rate of 1200 baud normally uses a frequency of 2200 Hz
for the space and 1200 Hz for the mark.
T8A02
What type of modulation is commonly used for VHF packet radio transmissions?
A. FM or PM
B. SSB
C. AM
D. PSK
Amplitude modulation, or AM, is another type of modulation. To amplitude modulate a signal, you
vary the amplitude of the signal in proportion to the audio level. Single-sideband, or SSB, is a form of
amplitude modulation. SSB is a better choice than FM for long-distance (weak signal) contacts on the
VHF and UHF bands because it is more energy-efficient than FM, and this is important when trying to
send signals long distances.
T8A01
Which of the following is a form of amplitude modulation?
A. Spread spectrum
B. Packet radio
C. Single sideband
D. Phase shift keying (PSK)
T8A03
Which type of voice mode is often used for long-distance (weak signal) contacts on the
VHF and UHF bands?
A. FM
57

B. DRM
C. SSB
D. PM
A single-sideband signal may be upper-sideband (USB) or lower-sideband (LSB). On frequencies above
14 MHz, amateurs normally use upper sideband.
T8A06
Which sideband is normally used for 10 meter HF, VHF, and UHF single-sideband
communications?
A. Upper sideband
B. Lower sideband
C. Suppressed sideband
D. Inverted sideband
The audio of an FM signal sounds better than an AM signal, but it occupies a wider bandwidth than an
AM or single sideband signal. This means that you can have fewer FM signals in a given frequency
range than SSB signals. A SSB signal is typically 3 kHz wide, while a VHF FM repeater voice signal is
10 – 15 kHz. wide.
T8A07
What is a characteristic of single sideband (SSB) compared to FM?
A. SSB signals are easier to tune in correctly
B. SSB signals are less susceptible to interference
C. SSB signals have narrower bandwidth
D. All these choices are correct
T8A08
What is the approximate bandwidth of a typical single sideband (SSB) voice signal?
A. 1 kHz
B. 3 kHz
C. 6 kHz
D. 15 kHz
T8A09
What is the approximate bandwidth of a VHF repeater FM voice signal?
A. Less than 500 Hz
B. About 150 kHz
C. Between 10 and 15 kHz
D. Between 50 and 125 kHz
Another disadvantage of FM when compared to SSB signals is that you can only receive one signal at a
time. When two signals are present at the input of an FM receiver, the receiver will suppress the weaker
signal and only demodulate the stronger signal. This is known as the capture effect.
T8A12
Which of the following is a disadvantage of FM compared with single sideband?
A. Voice quality is poorer
B. Only one signal can be received at a time
C. FM signals are harder to tune
58

D. All these choices are correct
Some modes have very wide bandwidths, such as AM fast-scan TV. Analog fast-scan color TV signals
are sometimes referred to as NTSC signals because the standard for this type of signal was established
by the National Television System Committee, or NTSC.
T8A10
What is the approximate bandwidth of AM fast-scan TV transmissions?
A. More than 10 MHz
B. About 6 MHz
C. About 3 MHz
D. About 1 MHz
T8D04
What type of transmission is indicated by the term "NTSC?"
A. A Normal Transmission mode in Static Circuit
B. A special mode for satellite uplink
C. An analog fast-scan color TV signal
D. A frame compression scheme for TV signals

Morse Code, or CW, signals have a narrower bandwidth than either AM or FM. The bandwidth of a
CW signal is approximately 150 Hz. Technicians have CW privileges on the 80m, 40m, 15m, and 10m
bands, as well as all the VHF, UHF, and microwave bands.
T8D09
What is CW?
A. A type of electromagnetic propagation

D. Slow-scan TV
T8A11
What is the approximate bandwidth required to transmit a CW signal?
A. 2.4 kHz
B. 150 Hz
C. 1000 Hz
D. 15 kHz
To send Morse Code you can use a straight key or a paddle. A straight key has one set of contacts, and
you make the dits and dahs manually by holding it down for different lengths of time. A paddle, on the

59

other hand, has two sets of contacts which are connected to an electronic keyer. When one set of contacts
is closed, the electronic keyer sends dits. When the other set is closed, the electronic keyer sends dahs.
T4A12
What is an electronic keyer?
A. A device for switching antennas from transmit to receive
B. A device for voice activated switching from receive to transmit
C. A device that assists in manual sending of Morse code
D. An interlock to prevent unauthorized use of a radio

60

Digital modes: packet, PSK31
When hams talk about “digital modes,” we are talking about modes that send digital data rather than
voice or other types of analog signals, such as television. Usually, we connect our transceivers to a
computer to modulate and demodulate the digital signals, but some transceivers can do this internally.
T8D01
Which of the following is a digital communications mode?
A. Packet radio
B. IEEE 802.11
C. FT8
D. All these choices are correct
Packet radio was one of the first digital modes. It is called packet radio because the data to be sent from
station to station are separated into a number of packets which are then sent separately by the
transmitting station and received and re-assembled by the receiving station.
T8D08
Which of the following is included in packet radio transmissions?
A. A check sum that permits error detection
B. A header that contains the call sign of the station to which the information is being sent
C. Automatic repeat request in case of error
D. All these choices are correct
Some amateur radio digital communications systems use protocols which ensure error-free
communications. One such system is called an automatic repeat request, or ARQ, transmission system.
T8D11
What is an ARQ transmission system?
A. A special transmission format limited to video signals
B. A system used to encrypt command signals to an amateur radio satellite
C. An error correction method in which the receiving station detects errors and sends a
request for retransmission
D. A method of compressing data using autonomous reiterative Q codes prior to final
encoding

Automatic Packet Reporting System. or APRS, is one service that uses packet radio. The major
application of APRS is to send location reports while operating a mobile amateur radio station. It can
do this because APRS stations generally include a GPS receiver. In addition to sending GPS position
data, radio amateur also use APRS to send text messages, and weather data.
T8D05
Which of the following is an application of APRS?
A. Providing real-time tactical digital communications in conjunction with a map
showing the locations of stations
B. Showing automatically the number of packets transmitted via PACTOR during a
specific time interval
C. Providing voice over internet connection between repeaters
61

D. Providing information on the number of stations signed into a repeater
T8D03
What kind of data can be transmitted by APRS?
A. GPS position data
B. Text messages
C. Weather data
D. All these choices are correct
A popular digital mode on the HF bands is PSK31. PSK31 is a type of phase shift keying (PSK). PSK
signals are modulated by shifting the phase of the tone being sent.
T8D06
What does the abbreviation "PSK" mean?
A. Pulse Shift Keying
B. Phase Shift Keying
C. Packet Short Keying
D. Phased Slide Keying
The “31” in PSK31 comes from the fact that data is transmitted and received at about 31 baud and that
the bandwidth of a PSK31 signal is only about 31 Hz. Fortunately, that is about how fast most people
can type.

Digital Mobile Radio, or DMR, is an FM digital communications system that’s become quite popular
in amateur radio. It allows amateur radio operators to use the spectrum more efficiently by timemultiplexing two signals in a single 12.5 kHz repeater channel. It also allows amateur radio operators to
connect with one another over the internet.
T8D07
Which of the following describes DMR?
A. A technique for time-multiplexing two digital voice signals on a single 12.5 kHz
repeater channel
B. An automatic position tracking mode for FM mobiles communicating through repeaters
C. An automatic computer logging technique for hands-off logging when communicating
while operating a vehicle

Amateur radio station safety
Electrical safety
BE SAFE!
When operating or working on amateur radio equipment, it’s possible to come into contact with
dangerous voltages and currents. People have died working on high-voltage circuits. Because it would
be a shame to lose a single person, it’s important to know how to be safe when working with electricity.
30 volts is the commonly accepted value for the lowest voltage that can cause a dangerous electric
shock, and only 100 mA flowing through the body can cause death. These are not very large values.
T0A02
What health hazard is presented by electrical current flowing through the body?
A. It may cause injury by heating tissue
B. It may disrupt the electrical functions of cells
C. It may cause involuntary muscle contractions
D. All these choices are correct
Start by ensuring that your amateur radio station has three-wire electrical outlets that are properly wired
and grounded. When properly wired, three-wire electrical outlets and plugs are safer than two-wire
outlets and plugs, and you should use three-wire plugs for all of your amateur radio equipment. In the
United States, the three wires are hot, neutral, and safety ground, These are color-coded black, white,
and green, respectively. In addition to ensuring that all AC outlets are properly wired, install
mechanical interlocks in high-voltage circuits that disconnect power when equipment enclosures that
contain those circuits are opened.
T0A03
In the United States, what circuit does black wire insulation indicate in a three-wire
120 V cable?
A. Neutral
B. Hot
C. Equipment ground
D. Black insulation is never used
T0A06
What is a good way to guard against electrical shock at your station?
A. Use three-wire cords and plugs for all AC powered equipment
B. Connect all AC powered station equipment to a common safety ground
C. Install mechanical interlocks in high-voltage circuits
D. All these choices are correct
Installing fuses in an electrical circuit is the main way to protect a circuit from excessive current flow, or
overload. Fuses are designed to “blow” or remove power from equipment if the current flowing through
them exceeds a specified value. Fuses should always be in series with the hot conductor only.
64

T0A04
What is the purpose of a fuse in an electrical circuit?
A. To prevent power supply ripple from damaging a component
B. To remove power in case of overload
C. To limit current to prevent shocks
D. All these choices are correct
T0A08
Where should a fuse or circuit breaker be installed in a 120V AC power circuit?
A. In series with the hot conductor only
B. In series with the hot and neutral conductors
C. In parallel with the hot conductor only
D. In parallel with the hot and neutral conductors
When replacing a fuse, always replace the blown fuse with a fuse of the same type and value. Using a
fuse with a larger current rating may allow excessive current to flow in the circuit and cause it to catch
fire.
T0A05
Why should a 5-ampere fuse never be replaced with a 20-ampere fuse?
A. The larger fuse would be likely to blow because it is rated for higher current
B. The power supply ripple would greatly increase
C. Excessive current could cause a fire
D. All these choices are correct
Whenever you’re working on equipment, be sure to disconnect it from the power lines, and even then
be careful when working near a power supply’s capacitors. Some power supplies have large capacitors in
their output circuits that can store a lot of charge, and if you come into contact with them before they
are discharged, you may receive an electrical shock. I always measure a power supply’s output voltage
before working on it or connecting or disconnecting equipment to the supply.
T0A11
What hazard exists in a power supply immediately after turning it off?
A. Circulating currents in the dc filter
B. Leakage flux in the power transformer
C. Voltage transients from kickback diodes
D. Charge stored in filter capacitors

You also need to take precautions when using batteries to power your amateur radio station.
Conventional 12-volt storage batteries present several safety hazards.
T0A01
Which of the following is a safety hazard of a 12-volt storage battery?
A. Touching both terminals with the hands can cause electrical shock
B. Shorting the terminals can cause burns, fire, or an explosion

D. All these choices are correct
T0A10
65

What hazard is caused by charging or discharging a battery too quickly?
A. Overheating or out-gassing
B. Excess output ripple
C. Half-wave rectification
D. Inverse memory effect

66

Antenna and tower safety
Antenna safety is also of primary concern. There are two aspects of antenna safety—being safe when
installing an antenna and safely operating an antenna. When installing an antenna, make sure you note
where the power lines are and position the antenna, so that if it falls, no part of it comes closer than 10

A. Secure the guy line if the turnbuckle breaks
B. Prevent loosening of the turnbuckle from vibration
C. Provide a ground path for lightning strikes
D. Provide an ability to measure for proper tensioning

Grounding is very important when installing a tower. The tower is, after all, basically a big lightning
rod. Proper grounding will help shunt a lightning strike to earth before it can get into your amateur
radio station.
T0B11
Which of the following establishes grounding requirements for an amateur radio
tower or antenna?
A. FCC Part 97 rules
B. Local electrical codes
C. FAA tower lighting regulations
D. UL recommended practices
T0B08
Which is a proper grounding method for a tower?
A. A single four-foot ground rod, driven into the ground no more than 12 inches from the
base
B. A ferrite-core RF choke connected between the tower and ground
C. A connection between the tower base and a cold water pipe

other

68

T0B01

Lightning can also be conducted down a feed line and into your station. To prevent this, several
manufacturers make devices called lightning arrestors that are designed to conduct this current to
ground before it gets into the station. Mount lightning arrestors on a grounded panel near where feed
lines enter a building.
T0A07
Where should a lightning arrester be installed in a coaxial feed line?
A. At the output connector of a transceiver
B. At the antenna feed point
C. At the ac power service panel

69

RF hazards and radiation exposure
Even though radio waves are non-ionizing radiation, over-exposure to RF energy can be a safety hazard.
T0C01
What type of radiation are radio signals?

damage DNA
B. RF radiation can only be detected with an RF dosimeter
C. RF radiation is limited in range to a few feet
D. RF radiation is perfectly safe
To ensure that your amateur radio station is operating safely, the FCC has set exposure limits. As an
amateur radio station licensee, you are responsible for ensuring that no person is exposed to RF energy
above these limits. There are three ways to determine whether your station complies with FCC RF
exposure regulations:
•

By calculation based on FCC OET Bulletin 65

•

By calculation based on computer modeling

•

By measurement of field strength using calibrated equipment
T0C13
Who is responsible for ensuring that no person is exposed to RF energy above the FCC
exposure limits?
A. The FCC
B. The station licensee
C. Anyone who is near an antenna
D. The local zoning board
T0C06
Which of the following is an acceptable method to determine whether your station
complies with FCC RF exposure regulations?
A. By calculation based on FCC OET Bulletin 65
B. By calculation based on computer modeling
C. By measurement of field strength using calibrated equipment
D. All these choices are correct

One of the factors to consider when performing an RF exposure evaluation is duty cycle. Duty cycle is
defined as the percentage of time that a transmitter is transmitting. Duty cycle is important because it
affects a person’s average exposure to RF radiation. A transmission with a lower duty cycle would be less
hazardous than a high duty cycle transmission.
70

T0C11
What is the definition of duty cycle during the averaging time for RF exposure?
A. The difference between the lowest power output and the highest power output of a
transmitter
B. The difference between the PEP and average power output of a transmitter
C. The percentage of time that a transmitter is transmitting
D. The percentage of time that a transmitter is not transmitting
T0C10
Why is duty cycle one of the factors used to determine safe RF radiation exposure
levels?
A. It affects the average exposure to radiation
B. It affects the peak exposure to radiation
C. It takes into account the antenna feed line loss
D. It takes into account the thermal effects of the final amplifier
T0C03
How does the allowable power density for RF safety change if duty cycle changes from
100 percent to 50 percent?
A. It increases by a factor of 3
B. It decreases by 50 percent
C. It increases by a factor of 2
D. There is no adjustment allowed for lower duty cycle
Because of the way radio waves interact with the body, the exposure limits are different for each
amateur radio band. Oddly, 50 MHz is the frequency at which the human body absorbs the most
radiation. In addition to the frequency and power level of the RF field, the distance from an amateur
station antenna and radiation pattern of the antenna affect how much RF exposure that people will
experience near the antenna.
T0C05
Why do exposure limits vary with frequency?
A. Lower frequency RF fields have more energy than higher frequency fields
B. Lower frequency RF fields do not penetrate the human body
C. Higher frequency RF fields are transient in nature
D. The human body absorbs more RF energy at some frequencies than at others
T0C02
At which of the following frequencies does maximum permissible exposure have the
lowest value?
A. 3.5 MHz
B. 50 MHz
C. 440 MHz
D. 1296 MHz
T0C04
What factors affect the RF exposure of people near an amateur station antenna?
A. Frequency and power level of the RF field
B. Distance from the antenna to a person
C. Radiation pattern of the antenna
71

D. All these choices are correct
So, what should you do if your RF exposure evaluation shows that people are being exposed to excessive
RF?
T0C08
Which of the following actions can reduce exposure to RF radiation?
A. Relocate antennas
B. Relocate the transmitter
C. Increase the duty cycle
D. All these choices are correct
You could also lower the power or simply transmit less.
Finally, you should regularly evaluate your station for RF safety.
T0C09
How can you make sure your station stays in compliance with RF safety regulations?
A. By informing the FCC of any changes made in your station
B. By re-evaluating the station whenever an item in the transmitter or antenna system
is changed
C. By making sure your antennas have low SWR
D. All these choices are correct

72

Station setup and operating controls
Station setup
When setting up an amateur radio station, choosing the radio is the most important consideration, but
you must also choose a wide range of accessories, such as power supplies and microphones. In addition,
how you connect all these pieces of equipment together is important for your station to operate
properly.
For example, a transceiver’s DC power cable should be made with short, heavy-gauge wires. When
transmitting, the transceiver draws a lot of current, and there will be a measurable voltage drop between
the power supply and the transceiver. If this voltage drop is too large, the transceiver could malfunction.
The reason for this voltage drop is the resistance of the wires connecting the power supply to the
transceiver. Short, heavy-gauge wires have a lower resistance than long, thin wires, and will therefore,
cause a lower voltage drop.
T4A03
Why are short, heavy-gauge wires used for a transceiver’s DC power connection?
A. To minimize voltage drop when transmitting
B. To provide a good counterpoise for the antenna
C. To avoid RF interference
D. All these choices are correct
When choosing a power supply, check the voltage and current ratings of the supply and be sure to
choose one capable of supplying the proper voltage and current to power your radio. Let’s look at an
example.
T4A01
Which of the following is an appropriate power supply rating for a typical 50 watt
output mobile FM transceiver?
A. 24.0 volts at 4 amperes
B. 13.8 volts at 4 amperes
C. 24.0 volts at 12 amperes
D. 13.8 volts at 12 amperes
There are two reasons why D is the correct answer. First, most mobile FM transceivers are designed to
operate with a supply voltage between 11 V and 15 V. That means that the correct answer has to be
either B or D. Second, B is incorrect because transceivers are 50% efficient at best, meaning that a 50
W output transceiver will need at least 100 W of power to operate correctly. A supply providing 13.8 V
at 4 amperes is supplying only 55 W of power (P = E x I = 13.8 x 4 = 55.2 W), so this supply would be
under-powered. That leaves D—13.8 volts at 12 amperes—as the correct answer.

A computer has become a common accessory in many amateur radio stations. Amateurs use them to
operate digital modes, log contacts, and design circuits and antennas. I even use mine to Twitter while
I’m on the air. When operating digital modes, such as FT8, you connect the transceiver’s receive audio,
73

transmit audio, and transmitter keying to a computer. The transceiver audio output, such as the speaker
connection, connects to the computer “line in.” Similarly, the transceiver audio input connects to the
“line out” of the computer.
T4A06
What signals are used in a computer-radio interface for digital mode operation?
A. Receive and transmit mode, status, and location
B. Antenna and RF power
C. Receive audio, transmit audio, and transmitter keying
D. NMEA GPS location and DC power
T4A04
How are the transceiver audio input and output connected in a station configured to
operate using FT8?
A. To a computer running a terminal program and connected to a terminal node controller
unit
B. To the audio input and output of a computer running WSJT-X software
C. To an FT8 conversion unit, a keyboard, and a computer monitor
D. To a computer connected to the FT8converter.com website
T4A07
Which of the following connections is made between a computer and a transceiver to
use computer software when operating digital modes?
A. Computer “line out” to transceiver push-to-talk
B. Computer “line in” to transceiver push-to-talk
C. Computer “line in” to transceiver speaker connector
D. Computer “line out” to transceiver speaker connector
Audio, microphone, and power supply cables in an amateur radio station sometimes pick up stray RF
when you’re transmitting. At minimum, this RF can cause the audio to be distorted. At worst, it can
cause a radio or accessory to malfunction. One way to cure this problem is by installing a ferrite choke
on the shield of the microphone cable to block or “choke” any RF currents induced on the cable.
T7B04
Which of the following could you use to cure distorted audio caused by RF current on
the shield of a microphone cable?
A. Band-pass filter
B. Low-pass filter
C. Preamplifier
D. Ferrite choke
Good grounding techniques can help you avoid interference problems. When grounding your
equipment, you should connect the various pieces of equipment to a single point, keep leads short, and
use flat copper strap to connect that point to ground. We sometimes call this process bonding.
T4A08
Which of the following conductors is preferred for bonding at RF?
A. Copper braid removed from coaxial cable
B. Steel wire
C. Twisted-pair cable
74

D. Flat copper strap

If you plan to install a radio in your car and operate mobile, you have a different set of challenges. One
of these challenges is how to connect your radio to the car’s power system. Some amateurs power their
radio a 12-volt auxiliary power jack, but this jack is not designed for high currents. For permanent
installations, you need to connect the negative power return to the 12 volt battery chassis ground.
T4A11
Where should the negative power return of a mobile transceiver be connected in a
vehicle?
A. At the 12 volt battery chassis ground
B. At the antenna mount
C. To any metal part of the vehicle
D. Through the transceiver’s mounting bracket
The positive connection can be made at the battery or through an unused position of the vehicle’s fuse
block.
You can also operate your equipment from a battery when operating portable or at home should the
power be off. Of course, batteries have a finite life, and the more current you draw from the battery,
the faster it will discharge. To determine how long you can operate using battery power, divide the
battery ampere-hour rating by the average current draw of the equipment. For example, if you have a
10 amp-hour battery, and the average current draw is 1 amp, then you can operate for approximately
10 hours: operating time = 10 amp-hours / 1 amp = 10 hours.
T4A09
How can you determine the length of time that equipment can be powered from a
battery?
A. Divide the watt-hour rating of the battery by the peak power consumption of the
equipment
B. Divide the battery ampere-hour rating by the average current draw of the
equipment
C. Multiply the watts per hour consumed by the equipment by the battery power rating
D. Multiply the square of the current rating of the battery by the input resistance of the
equipment

75

Operating controls
To properly operate a transceiver, you need to know how to use the controls. Perhaps the most
important transmitter control is microphone gain. Setting the gain too high will result in distorted
audio.
T4B01
What is the effect of excessive microphone gain on SSB transmissions?
A. Frequency instability
B. Distorted transmitted audio
C. Increased SWR
D. All these choices are correct
You also need to know how to properly set the operating frequency of your transceiver. One reason for
this is that setting the frequency of an FM receiver above or below a signal’s frequency will result in
distorted receive audio.
T4B12
What is the result of tuning an FM receiver above or below a signal’s frequency?
A. Change in audio pitch
B. Sideband inversion
C. Generation of a heterodyne tone
D. Distortion of the signal’s audio
Many modern transceivers allow you to set the operating frequency in several different ways:
•
•
•

Punching in a number on a keypad.
Rotating the VFO knob.
Storing it in a memory channel and then recalling it for quick access.
T4B02
Which of the following can be used to enter a transceiver’s operating frequency?
A. The keypad or VFO knob
B. The CTCSS or DTMF encoder
C. The Automatic Frequency Control
D. All these choices are correct
T4B04
What is a way to enable quick access to a favorite frequency or channel on your
transceiver?
A. Enable the frequency offset
B. Store it in a memory channel
C. Enable the VOX
D. Use the scan mode to select the desired frequency

Transceivers that allow you to store frequencies in memory often have the ability to step through those
frequencies, one at a time, stopping when a signal is received. This is called scanning and allows you to
tune through a range of frequencies to check for activity.
T4B05
76

What does the scanning function of an FM transceiver do?
A. Checks incoming signal deviation
B. Prevents interference to nearby repeaters
C. Tunes through a range of frequencies to check for activity
D. Checks for messages left on a digital bulletin board
A common receiver control on VHF/UHF transceivers is the squelch control. Its purpose is to mute the
receiver audio unless you are receiving a signal above a set signal strength.
T2B13
What is the purpose of a squelch function?
A. Reduce a CW transmitter's key clicks
B. Mute the receiver audio when a signal is not present
C. Eliminate parasitic oscillations in an RF amplifier
D. Reduce interference from impulse noise

How is squelch adjusted so that a weak FM signal can be heard?
A. Set the squelch threshold so that receiver output audio is on all the time
B. Turn up the audio level until it overcomes the squelch threshold
C. Turn on the anti-squelch function
D. Enable squelch enhancement
Another common setting on VHF/UHF transceivers is the offset frequency. This is especially important
when operating repeaters. This setting specifies the difference between the repeater’s transmit frequency
and receive frequency.
T2A07
What is meant by "repeater offset”?
A. The difference between a repeater’s transmit and receive frequencies
B. The repeater has a time delay to prevent interference
C. The repeater station identification is done on a separate frequency
D. The number of simultaneous transmit frequencies used by a repeater

In recent years, radios that digitize one’s voice and then send the digitized voice over the air have
become quite popular. The operating modes that these radios use are called digital modes. Two of the
most popular digital modes are DMR (Digital Mobile Radio) and D-STAR (Digital Smart Technology
for Amateur Radio).
One of the reasons digital modes are so popular is that the digitized voice information can not only be
transmitted over the air, but also over the internet. To connect to other radio amateurs over the
internet, digital mode radios can use a repeater that is connected to the internet or a digital mode hot
spot that connect to the internet via a personal computer or smart phone with an internet connection.
T4A10
What function is performed with a transceiver and a digital mode hot spot?
A. Communication using digital voice or data systems via the internet
B. FT8 digital communications via AFSK
77

C. RTTY encoding and decoding without a computer
D. High-speed digital communications for meteor scatter
DMR has a feature called talkgroups. Talk groups are virtual channels, and when you access a talkgroup,
your signal is routed to other radio amateurs who have also accessed that talkgroup, no matter where in
the world they are. To use this feature, you must program your radio to properly access repeaters and
the talkgroups. This programming information is contained in a DMR radio’s code plug.
T8D02

A. By retrieving the frequencies from transceiver memory
B. By enabling the group’s CTCSS tone
C. By entering the group’s identification code
D. By activating automatic identification
One of the bits of information that you enter into the code plug is the color code.
T2B12
What is the purpose of the color code used on DMR repeater systems?
A. Must match the repeater color code for access
B. Defines the frequency pair to use
C. Identifies the codec used
D. Defines the minimum signal level required for access
Part of the information sent when you use a digital voice transceiver, be it a DMR or D-STAR radio, is
your call sign. Before you use the radio, you must program the radio with your call sign.
T4B11
78

Which of the following must be programmed into a D-STAR digital transceiver before
transmitting?
A. Your call sign
B. Your output power
C. The codec type being used
D. All these choices are correct

HF transceivers have many controls not found on VHF/UHF FM transceivers. For example, they are
often equipped with a variety of different filters. The reason for this is that using the appropriate filter
for the mode you are operating can make operating a lot easier.
T4B08
What is the advantage of having multiple receive bandwidth choices on a multimode
transceiver?
A. Permits monitoring several modes at once by selecting a separate filter for each mode
B. Permits noise or interference reduction by selecting a bandwidth matching the
mode

T4B10
Which of the following receiver filter bandwidths provides the best signal-to-noise
ratio for SSB reception?
A. 500 Hz
B. 1000 Hz
C. 2400 Hz
D. 5000 Hz
A common receiver control on HF transceivers is the Receiver Incremental Tuning, or RIT, control. Its
purpose is to set the receive frequency slightly off from the transmit frequency. On some radios, this
control is called the clarifier.
T4B06
Which of the following controls could be used if the voice pitch of a single-sideband
signal returning to your CQ call seems too high or low?
A. The AGC or limiter
B. The bandwidth selection
C. The tone squelch
D. The RIT or Clarifier
A common transmitter control is push-to-talk, or PTT. Most of the time PTT refers to an actual switch
on the microphone that an operator must push to begin transmitting, but it also refers to the name of a
signal line on a transceiver’s accessory socket that can be used to automatically switch a transceiver into
transmit mode.
T7A07
What is the function of a transceiver’s PTT input?
A. Input for a key used to send CW
79

B. Switches transceiver from receive to transmit when grounded
C. Provides a transmit tuning tone when grounded
D. Input for a preamplifier tuning tone

80

Station equipment
Receivers, transmitters, transceivers, and transverters
In the early days of radio, radio amateurs used separate receivers and transmitter units. Nowadays,
however, most use radios that combine function both as the transmitter and receiver. These units are
called transceivers.
T7A02
What is a transceiver?
A. A device that combines a receiver and transmitter
B. A device for matching feed line impedance to 50 ohms
C. A device for automatically sending and decoding Morse code
D. A device for converting receiver and transmitter frequencies to another band
Often, HF transceivers are used with devices called transverters that convert the signals from an HF
transceiver to the VHF, UHF, and even microwave bands. Transverters take the output of an HF
transceiver, normally set to the 10-meter (28 MHz) band and output a VHF, UHF, or microwave
signal. Conversely, they receive a VHF, UHF, or microwave signal and output a signal in the 10-meter
band that is demodulated by the HF transceiver.
T7A06
What device converts the RF input and output of a transceiver to another band?
A. High pass filter
B. Low-pass filter
C. Transverter
D. Phase converter
Many, if not most, new amateurs buy a handheld transceiver, called an “HT,” as their first transceiver.
One disadvantage of using a handheld transceiver is that the maximum output power is generally only 5
W, and because of this, they have limited range. To get around this limitation, you can use an RF
amplifier to boost the power.
T7A10
What device increases the transmitted output power from a transceiver?
A. A voltage divider
B. An RF power amplifier
C. An impedance network
D. All these choices are correct
T7A09
What is the function of the SSB/CW-FM switch on a VHF power amplifier?
A. Change the mode of the transmitted signal
B. Set the amplifier for proper operation in the selected mode
C. Change the frequency range of the amplifier to operate in the proper segment of the
band
D. Reduce the received signal noise
When talking about a transceiver’s specifications, we still refer to its receiver and transmitter. The two
81

most important receiver specifications are sensitivity and selectivity.
T7A01
Which term describes the ability of a receiver to detect the presence of a signal?
A. Linearity
B. Sensitivity
C. Selectivity
D. Total Harmonic Distortion
T7A04
Which term describes the ability of a receiver to discriminate between multiple signals?
A. Discrimination ratio
B. Sensitivity
C. Selectivity
D. Harmonic distortion
To improve the sensitivity of a receiver, you can use an RF preamplifier. An RF preamplifier amplifies
signals that you want to receive.
T7A11
Where is an RF preamplifier installed?
A. Between the antenna and receiver
B. At the output of the transmitter power amplifier
C. Between the transmitter and the antenna tuner
D. At the output of the receiver audio amplifier

Many HF transceivers have some version of a superheterodyne receiver. A superheterodyne receiver
converts an incoming radio signal to an intermediate frequency, or IF. The circuit that does this is the
mixer.
T7A03
Which of the following is used to convert a signal from one frequency to another?
A. Phase splitter
B. Mixer
C. Inverter
D. Amplifier
When transmitting or receiving, we want to generate an RF signal with a specific frequency. To do that,
we use an oscillator.
T7A05
What is the name of a circuit that generates a signal at a specific frequency?
A. Reactance modulator
B. Phase modulator
C. Low-pass filter
D. Oscillator
To transmit a voice or data signal, we have to combine an audio frequency signal from the microphone
with the RF carrier signal generated by the transmitter. This is done with a circuit called a modulator,
82

and the process of combining speech with an RF carrier signal is called modulation.
T7A08
Which of the following describes combining speech with an RF carrier signal?
A. Impedance matching
B. Oscillation
C. Modulation
D. Low-pass filtering

83

Symptoms, causes, and cures of common transmitter and receiver
problems
Since Murphy’s Law—the law that states if anything can go wrong, it will—applies to amateur radio as
much as it does to any other pursuit, at some point you will have to deal with problems. These may
include overload, distortion, feedback, and radio frequency interference, or RFI.
Let’s first consider radio frequency interference.
T7B03
Which of the following can cause radio frequency interference?
A. Fundamental overload
B. Harmonics
C. Spurious emissions
D. All these choices are correct
Any of these could cause interference to a TV set or radio or even computer speakers, and you will want
to take steps to find and eliminate that interference. The first thing that you should do if your neighbor
complains about interference is to make sure that your station is functioning properly by making sure
that your transmissions do not cause interference to your radios or televisions.
T7B06
Which of the following actions should you take if a neighbor tells you that your
station’s transmissions are interfering with their radio or TV reception?
A. Make sure that your station is functioning properly and that it does not cause
interference to your own radio or television when it is tuned to the same channel
B. Immediately turn off your transmitter and contact the nearest FCC office for assistance
C. Install a harmonic doubler on the output of your transmitter and tune it until the
interference is eliminated
D. All these choices are correct
While it’s not very likely that your amateur radio station will interfere with a neighbor’s cable TV
service, it can sometimes occur. If you are interfering with a neighbor’s cable TV service, first check the
coax connectors.
T7B09
What should be the first step to resolve non-fiber optic cable TV interference caused
by your amateur radio transmission?
A. Add a low-pass filter to the TV antenna input
B. Add a high-pass filter to the TV antenna input
C. Add a preamplifier to the TV antenna input
D. Be sure all TV feed line coaxial connectors are installed properly
Your amateur radio station may interfere with a nearby radio receiver if your signal is so strong that the
receiver cannot reject the signal even though your signal is not on the frequency to which the receiver is
tuned. This is called fundamental overload.
T7B02
What would cause a broadcast AM or FM radio to receive an amateur radio
84

transmission unintentionally?
A. The receiver is unable to reject strong signals outside the AM or FM band
B. The microphone gain of the transmitter is turned up too high
C. The audio amplifier of the transmitter is overloaded
D. The deviation of an FM transmitter is set too low
To reduce or eliminate fundamental overload, you can install a filter at the radio or TV input to block
the interfering signal.
T7B05
How can fundamental overload of a non-amateur radio or TV receiver by an amateur
signal be reduced or eliminated?
A. Block the amateur signal with a filter at the antenna input of the affected receiver
B. Block the interfering signal with a filter on the amateur transmitter
C. Switch the transmitter from FM to SSB
D. Switch the transmitter to a narrow-band mode
The process can work the other way, too. When driving by the antenna of a high-power broadcast
station you may notice that your VHF transceiver is picking up the broadcast station signal. This is
often the result of overload. To reduce this interference, you may want to install a band-reject filter
designed to attenuate signals in the FM broadcast band.
T7B07
Which of the following can reduce overload of a VHF transceiver by a nearby
commercial FM station?
A. Installing an RF preamplifier
B. Using double-shielded coaxial cable
C. Installing bypass capacitors on the microphone cable
D. Installing a band-reject filter

Interference works both ways. Your neighbors may have wireless devices that can interfere with your
station. While they are responsible for eliminating the interference, chances are they don’t have the
expertise necessary to find and eliminate the interference, so your best option is to try and work with
them.
T7B08
What should you do if something in a neighbor’s home is causing harmful interference
to your amateur station?
A. Work with your neighbor to identify the offending device
B. Politely inform your neighbor that FCC rules prohibit the use of devices that cause
interference
C. Make sure your station meets the standards of good amateur practice
D. All these choices are correct

Perhaps the most common problem that amateur radio operators have is distorted or noisy audio when
transmitting. There are many reasons for poor audio.
85

T7B10
What might be a problem if you receive a report that your audio signal through an FM
repeater is distorted or unintelligible?
A. Your transmitter is slightly off frequency
B. Your batteries are running low
C. You are in a bad location
D. All these choices are correct
T7B11
What is a symptom of RF feedback in a transmitter or transceiver?
A. Excessive SWR at the antenna connection
B. The transmitter will not stay on the desired frequency
C. Reports of garbled, distorted, or unintelligible voice transmissions
D. Frequent blowing of power supply fuses
Sometimes, garbled or distorted audio when operating FM is the result of over-deviation. Overdeviation occurs when the amplitude of the audio modulating the transmitter is too high. Fortunately,
there’s an easy fix. Simply talk farther away from the microphone.
T7B01
What can you do if you are told your FM handheld or mobile transceiver is overdeviating?
A. Talk louder into the microphone
B. Let the transceiver cool off
C. Change to a higher power level
D. Talk farther away from the microphone

86

Using basic test instruments and soldering
The most common test instrument in an amateur radio shack is the multimeter. Multimeters are called
that because they combine the functions of a voltmeter, ohmmeter, and ammeter into a single
instrument.
T7D07
Which of the following measurements are made using a multimeter?
A. Signal strength and noise
B. Impedance and reactance
C. Voltage and resistance
D. All these choices are correct

The voltmeter function of the multimeter is used to measure electric potential, more commonly known
as voltage. You measure the voltage across a component or circuit by connecting the leads in parallel
with the component.
T7D01
Which instrument would you use to measure electric potential?
A. An ammeter
B. A voltmeter
C. A wavemeter
D. An ohmmeter
T7D02
How is a voltmeter connected to a component to measure applied voltage?
A. In series
B. In parallel
C. In quadrature
D. In phase
In order to avoid damaging the multimeter, make sure that it’s set to the voltage setting, not the
resistance setting when you want to measure voltage.
T7D06
Which of the following can damage a multimeter?
A. Attempting to measure resistance using the voltage setting
B. Failing to connect one of the probes to ground
C. Attempting to measure voltage when using the resistance setting
D. Not allowing it to warm up properly
If you are going to be measuring high voltages, make sure that the voltmeter and leads are rated for
those voltages. Failure to do so is unsafe and could result in damaging the meter.
T0A12
Which of the following precautions should be taken when measuring high voltages
with a voltmeter?
A. Ensure that the voltmeter has very low impedance
B. Ensure that the voltmeter and leads are rated for use at the voltages to be measured
87

C. Ensure that the circuit is grounded through the voltmeter
D. Ensure that the voltmeter is set to the correct frequency

The ohmmeter function of a multimeter is used to measure resistance. The way an ohmmeter measures
the resistance of a circuit is by supplying a known current to the circuit, measuring the voltage across
the circuit, and then calculating the resistance using Ohm's Law, R = V/I. Because we’re actually
measuring voltage, we connect an ohmmeter in parallel with a component to measure its resistance.
T7D05
How is an ohmmeter connected to a component to measure its resistance?
A. In parallel
B. In series
C. In cascade
D. All these choices are correct
T7D11
Which of the following precautions should be taken when measuring in-circuit
resistance with an ohmmeter?
A. Ensure that the applied voltages are correct
B. Ensure that the circuit is not powered
C. Ensure that the circuit is grounded
D. Ensure that the circuit is operating at the correct frequency
T7D10
What reading indicates that an ohmmeter is connected across a large, discharged
capacitor?
A. Increasing resistance with time
B. Decreasing resistance with time
C. Steady full-scale reading
D. Alternating between open and short circuit

The ammeter function of a multimeter is used to measure current. You connect an ammeter in series
with a circuit so that the current flowing through the circuit also flows through the ammeter.
T7D04
Which instrument is used to measure electric current?
A. An ohmmeter
B. An electrometer
C. A voltmeter
D. An ammeter
T7D03
When configured to measure current, how is a multimeter connected to a component?
A. In series
B. In parallel
C. In quadrature
D. In phase
88

In addition to knowing how to make electrical measurements, knowing how to solder is an essential
skill for amateur radio operators.
T7D08
Which of the following types of solder should not be used for radio and electronic
applications?
A. Acid-core solder
B. Lead-tin solder
C. Rosin-core solder
D. Tin-copper solder
Using acid-core solder could leave an acidic residue that will degrade the connection over time.
T7D09
What is the characteristic appearance of a cold tin-lead solder joint?
A. Dark black spots
B. A bright or shiny surface
C. A rough or lumpy surface
D. Excessive solder
We call a poor solder joint a “cold” solder joint because it's usually the result of not applying enough
heat to the joint. When you don't apply enough heat to a solder joint, the solder does not flow
smoothly between the metal surfaces to be joined and often does not make a good connection.

89

Operating procedures
FM Operation
Most Technicians purchase a VHF/UHF FM transceiver as their first amateur radio. This type of radio
allows them to use repeaters and participate in public-service events.
T1F09 [97.3(a)(40)]
What type of amateur station simultaneously retransmits the signal of another
amateur station on a different channel or channels?
A. Beacon station
B. Earth station
C. Repeater station
D. Message forwarding station
T1D07 [97.113(d)]
What types of amateur stations can automatically retransmit the signals of other
amateur stations?
A. Auxiliary, beacon, or Earth stations
B. Earth, repeater, or space stations
C. Beacon, repeater, or space stations
D. Repeater, auxiliary, or space stations
To increase the range of a repeater system, some repeater operators link their repeaters with other
repeaters. When linked in this way, a signal received by one repeater is retransmitted by all the other
repeaters in the network. This can give the repeater network extremely wide coverage.
T2B03
Which of the following describes a linked repeater network?
A. A network of repeaters in which signals received by one repeater are transmitted by
all the repeaters in the network
B. A single repeater with more than one receiver
C. Multiple repeaters with the same control operator
D. A system of repeaters linked by APRS

To use repeaters, you need to know how to set up your radio. Repeaters receive on one frequency and
transmit on another. You program your radio so that it receives on the repeater’s transmit frequency
and transmits on the repeater’s receive frequency. The difference between the transmit frequency and
receive frequency is called the repeater frequency offset. The frequency offset for 2-meter repeaters is
most often 600 kHz, while the most common repeater frequency offset in the 70-cm band is 5 MHz.
T2A01
What is a common repeater frequency offset in the 2 meter band?
A. Plus or minus 5 MHz
B. Plus or minus 600 kHz
C. Plus or minus 500 kHz
D. Plus or minus 1 MHz
90

T2A03
What is a common repeater frequency offset in the 70 cm band?
A. Plus or minus 5 MHz
B. Plus or minus 600 kHz
C. Plus or minus 500 kHz
D. Plus or minus 1 MHz

Because repeaters often operate in environments where there is a lot of interference, they are
programmed not to repeat a signal unless the signal has a sub-audible tone of a specific frequency. These
tones are sometimes called PL (short for “private line”) tones. PL is a Motorola trademark. The generic
term for these tones is CTCSS (short for “continuous tone-coded squelch system”). If your radio has
not been programmed to transmit the proper sub-audible tone when you transmit, the repeater will not
repeat your transmission.
T2B02
What term describes the use of a sub-audible tone transmitted along with normal voice
audio to open the squelch of a receiver?
A. Carrier squelch
B. Tone burst
C. DTMF
D. CTCSS
A frequent problem is being able to hear a repeater, but not being able to access it. There could be
several reasons for this.
T2B04
Which of the following could be the reason you are unable to access a repeater whose
output you can hear?
A. Improper transceiver offset
B. You are using the wrong CTCSS tone
C. You are using the wrong DCS code
D. All these choices are correct
A Digital Code Squelch, or DCS, tone is similar to a CTCSS tone in that it is sub-audible and opens
the squelch of a repeater when a station is trying to access it. They are, however, not very common.
If a station does not have a good signal into a repeater, you may want to listen for it on the repeater
input frequency. One way to listen to the repeater input frequency would be to use the reverse function
of your VHF/UHF transceiver, if it has this feature. When enabled, the reverse function will cause your
transceiver to transmit on the repeater output frequency and receive on the input frequency.
T2B01
How is a VHF/UHF transceiver’s “reverse” function used?
A. To reduce power output
B. To increase power output
C. To listen on a repeater’s input frequency
D. To listen on a repeater’s output frequency
91

Another problem you may encounter when operating FM is over-deviation. Over-deviation occurs
when the amplitude of the audio modulating the transmitter is too high. This can happen if you speak
too loudly into the microphone. This will cause your signal to deviate too much, and that can cause
distortion.
T2B05
What would cause your FM transmission audio to be distorted on voice peaks?
A. Your repeater offset is inverted
B. You need to talk louder
C. You are talking too loudly
D. Your transmit power is too high

In addition to knowing how to set the controls of your radio, you need to know the protocol for
making contacts. When using a repeater, the protocol is very simple. To make contact with another
station via a repeater, simply sat the station’s call sign, then identify by saying your call sign. To indicate
that you’re listening to a repeater and would like to make contact with another station, say your call
sign, then “listening” or “monitoring.”
T2A04
What is an appropriate way to call another station on a repeater if you know the other
station's call sign?
A. Say "break, break," then say the station's call sign
B. Say the station's call sign, then identify with your call sign
C. Say "CQ" three times, then the other station's call sign
D. Wait for the station to call CQ, then answer
T2A09
Which of the following indicates that a station is listening on a repeater and looking
for a contact?
A. “CQ CQ” followed by the station’s call sign
B. The station’s call sign followed by the word “monitoring”
C. The repeater call sign followed by the station’s call sign
D. “QSY” followed by your call sign
So, for example, if I want to talk to Ralph, AA8RK, on our local repeater, I would say, “AA8RK,
KB6NU.” If Ralph was listening—and was available to talk—he would then say, “KB6NU, AA8RK,”
and we would begin our contact. If I wasn’t looking for anyone in particular, I would say, “KB6NU
monitoring” or “KB6NU listening.”

Repeater operation is called duplex operation because you’re transmitting and receiving on two different
frequencies. When two stations are operating on the same frequency, without the aid of a repeater, it's
called simplex operation.
T2A11
What term describes an amateur station that is transmitting and receiving on the same
92

frequency?
A. Full duplex
B. Diplex
C. Simplex
D. Multiplex
On each VHF and UHF band, there are frequencies designated for simplex operation. Operating
simplex on these frequencies allows stations to communicate with one another without tying up a
repeater.
T2B09
Why are simplex channels designated in the VHF/UHF band plans?
A. So stations within range of each other can communicate without tying up a repeater
B. For contest operation
C. For working DX only
D. So stations with simple transmitters can access the repeater without automated offset
To help amateurs operating simplex find one another, a frequency on each band has been set aside as
the “national calling frequency.” 146.52 MHz is the national calling frequency for FM simplex
operation in the 2 m band.
T2A02
What is the national calling frequency for FM simplex operations in the 2 meter band?
A. 146.520 MHz
B. 145.000 MHz
C. 432.100 MHz
D. 446.000 MHz
446.000 MHz is the national calling frequency for the 70 cm band.

93

HF Operation
On the HF bands, signals can be easy to copy or difficult to copy. Because this is the case, the protocol
for making contacts is more complex than the repeater protocol. On HF, when you want to contact
another station, you “call CQ.” That is to say, you would say something like, “CQ CQ CQ. This is
KB6NU.” This means that you are open to a call from any station.
T2A08
What is the meaning of the procedural signal “CQ”?
A. Call on the quarter hour
B. Test transmission, no reply expected
C. Only the called station should transmit
D. Calling any station
You don’t want to just start calling CQ willy-nilly, though. Doing so might interfere with other
amateur stations. First, make sure that you are authorized to use that frequency. Then, listen to be sure
that no one else is using the frequency, and finally, ask if the frequency is in use.
T2A12
What should you do before calling CQ?
A. Listen first to be sure that no one else is using the frequency
B. Ask if the frequency is in use
C. Make sure you are authorized to use that frequency
D. All these choices are correct
Knowing how to reply to a CQ is also important. Knowing the commonly accepted protocol will make
it easier to make contacts.
T2A05
How should you respond to a station calling CQ?
A. Transmit "CQ" followed by the other station’s call sign
B. Transmit your call sign followed by the other station’s call sign
C. Transmit the other station’s call sign followed by your call sign
D. Transmit a signal report followed by your call sign
For example, if my friend Ralph, AA8RK, heard my call and wanted to talk to me, he would reply,
“KB6NU this is AA8RK. Over.” Then, I would return the call, and our contact would begin. If signal
conditions are poor, you may want to repeat your call sign and state your call sign in a phonetic
alphabet.

It’s important to always identify your station, even when only performing tests.
T2A06
Which of the following is required when making on-the-air test transmissions?
A. Identify the transmitting station
B. Conduct tests only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. local time
C. Notify the FCC of the transmissions
D. All these choices are correct
94

As a Technician, you will be able to operate Morse Code on certain portions of the 80 m, 40 m, 15 m,
and 10 m bands. To shorten the number of characters sent during a CW contact, amateurs often use
three-letter combinations called Q-signals. Q signals are three-letter combinations, beginning with the
letter “Q,” that stand for commonly-used phrases. You need to know the meaning of two of these Q
signals: QRM and QSY.
T2B10
Which Q signal indicates that you are receiving interference from other stations?
A. QRM
B. QRN
C. QTH
D. QSB
T2B11
Which Q signal indicates that you are changing frequency?
A. QRU
B. QSY
C. QSL
D. QRZ

FCC rules specify broadly where amateur radio operators have operating privileges, but they are not
very detailed. Band plans take this one step further, suggesting where amateurs should use certain
modes.
T2A10
What is a band plan, beyond the privileges established by the FCC?
A. A voluntary guideline for using different modes or activities within an amateur
band
B. A list of operating schedules
C. A list of available net frequencies
D. A plan devised by a club to indicate frequency band use

While not always adhered to, another basic tenet of amateur radio is to operate courteously and avoid
interfering with other stations.
T2B08
Which of the following applies when two stations transmitting on the same frequency
interfere with each other?
A. The stations should negotiate continued use of the frequency
B. Both stations should choose another frequency to avoid conflict
C. Interference is inevitable, so no action is required
D. Use subaudible tones so both stations can share the frequency

95

Public service and emergency communications
One of the reasons amateur radio exists at all is that ham radio operators are uniquely set up to provide
emergency and public-service communications. As a result, many hams consider it an obligation to be
prepared to help out when called upon to do so. This includes having the proper equipment and
knowing the proper operating procedures. There are two organizations that provide emergency
communications: the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES) and the Amateur Radio
Emergency Service (ARES).
T2C06
What is the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)?
A. A group of licensed amateurs who have voluntarily registered their qualifications
and equipment for communications duty in the public service
B. A group of licensed amateurs who are members of the military and who voluntarily
agreed to provide message handling services in the case of an emergency
C. A training program that provides licensing courses for those interested in obtaining an
amateur license to use during emergencies
D. A training program that certifies amateur operators for membership in the Radio
Amateur Civil Emergency Service
T1A10 [97.3(a)(38), 97.407]
What is the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES)?
A. A radio service using amateur frequencies for emergency management or civil defense
communications
B. A radio service using amateur stations for emergency management or civil defense
communications
C. An emergency service using amateur operators certified by a civil defense organization as
being enrolled in that organization
D. All these choices are correct
T2C04
What is RACES?
A. An emergency organization combining amateur radio and citizens band operators and
frequencies
B. An international radio experimentation society
C. A radio contest held in a short period, sometimes called a “sprint”
D. An FCC part 97 amateur radio service for civil defense communications during
national emergencies
When an emergency occurs, it’s common for amateur radio operators to form a network or “net” to
facilitate emergency communications. The net is led by the net control station, or NCS, whose job
includes calling the net to order and directing communications between stations checking in. Stations
other than the net control station are said to “check in” to the net.
T2C02
Which of the following are typical duties of a Net Control Station?
A. Choose the regular net meeting time and frequency
96

B. Ensure that all stations checking into the net are properly licensed for operation on the
net frequency
C. Call the net to order and direct communications between stations checking in
D. All these choices are correct
When you check into a net, you must take your lead from the net control station, and transmit only
when directed to by the net control station, unless you are reporting an emergency.
T2C07
Which of the following is standard practice when you participate in a net?
A. When first responding to the net control station, transmit your call sign, name, and
address as in the FCC database
B. Record the time of each of your transmissions
C. Unless you are reporting an emergency, transmit only when directed by the net
control station
D. All these choices are correct

One of the functions of an emergency communications net is to pass messages between stations that
have checked into the net. The term for messages passed between stations in a net is “traffic,” and the
process of passing messages to and from amateur radio stations is called handling traffic. When
handling traffic, you should try to pass messages exactly as received. One way to do this is to spell
names or unusual words using a standard phonetic alphabet.
T2C05
What does the term “traffic” refer to in net operation?
A. Messages exchanged by net stations
B. The number of stations checking in and out of a net|
C. Operation by mobile or portable stations
D. Requests to activate the net by a served agency
T2C08
Which of the following is a characteristic of good traffic handling?
A. Passing messages exactly as received
B. Making decisions as to whether messages are worthy of relay or delivery
C. Ensuring that any newsworthy messages are relayed to the news media
D. All these choices are correct
T2C03
What technique is used to ensure that voice messages containing unusual words are
received correctly?
A. Send the words by voice and Morse code
B. Speak very loudly into the microphone
C. Spell the words using a standard phonetic alphabet
D. All these choices are correct

Formal traffic messages consists of four parts: preamble, address, text, signature. The preamble contains
information needed to track the message. Part of the preamble is the check. The check is the number of
97

words or word equivalents in the text portion of the message. Operator use the check to help ensure
that a message is received exactly as sent.
T2C10
What information is contained in the preamble of a formal traffic message?
A. The email address of the originating station
B. The address of the intended recipient
C. The telephone number of the addressee
D. Information needed to track the message
T2C11
What is meant by “check” in a radiogram header?
A. The number of words or word equivalents in the text portion of the message
B. The call sign of the originating station
C. A list of stations that have relayed the message
D. A box on the message form that indicates that the message was received and/or relayed

Even in emergencies, you must follow FCC rules when operating an amateur radio station. The normal
rules are, however, relaxed a little during true emergencies.
T2C01 [97.103(a)]
When do FCC rules NOT apply to the operation of an amateur station?
A. When operating a RACES station
B. When operating under special FEMA rules
C. When operating under special ARES rules
D. FCC rules always apply
T2C09
Are amateur station control operators ever permitted to operate outside the frequency
privileges of their license class?
A. No
B. Yes, but only when part of a FEMA emergency plan
C. Yes, but only when part of a RACES emergency plan
D. Yes, but only in situations involving the immediate safety of human life or
protection of property
It's kind of a Catch-22. FCC rules always apply to the operation of an amateur radio station, but the
rules say that you can do almost anything in a true emergency.

98

Amateur satellite operation
Making contacts via amateur radio satellites and other space stations is one of the coolest things a ham
can do. As a Technician Class licensee, you will have the privileges to do this.
T1B02 [97.301, 97.207(c)]

Amateur satellites are basically repeaters in space. As such they have an uplink frequency, which is the
frequency on which you transmit and the satellite receives, and a downlink frequency, on which the
satellite transmits and you receive. Often, the uplink frequency and downlink frequency are in different
amateur bands.
T8B08
What is meant by the statement that a satellite is operating in U/V mode?
A. The satellite uplink is in the 15 meter band and the downlink is in the 10 meter band
B. The satellite uplink is in the 70 centimeter band and the downlink is in the 2 meter
band
C. The satellite operates using ultraviolet frequencies
D. The satellite frequencies are usually variable
The 70 cm band is in the UHF portion of the spectrum, hence the “U” in U/V, while the 2 meter band
is in the VHF portion of the spectrum, hence the “V” in U/V.
While most satellites are FM satellites, some operate using other modes.
T8B04
What mode of transmission is commonly used by amateur radio satellites?
A. SSB
B. FM
C. CW/data
D. All these choices are correct
When making contacts via an amateur satellite only use as much power as is needed to make the
contact. The reason for this is that when a satellite receives a very strong signal, its automatic gain
control (AGC) sets the receive threshold to the level of that signal and weaker signals won't be relayed.
When everyone uses a reasonable power level, the AGC doesn't kick in, and the satellite can relay many
signals simultaneously.
T8B02
What is the impact of using excessive effective radiated power on a satellite uplink?
A. Possibility of commanding the satellite to an improper mode
B. Blocking access by other users
99

C. Overloading the satellite batteries

T8B12
Which of the following is a way to determine whether your satellite uplink power is
neither too low nor too high?
A. Check your signal strength report in the telemetry data
B. Listen for distortion on your downlink signal
C. Your signal strength on the downlink should be about the same as the beacon
D. All these choices are correct

Most amateur satellites are in a low Earth orbit, or LEO. Satellites in a low Earth orbit have an altitude
between 99 miles and 1,200 miles. This corresponds to an orbital period of about 88 minutes to about
about 127 minutes. Satellites in LEO provides high bandwidth and low communication time lag, but
they can only be used for a short time when they pass overhead.
T8B10
What is a LEO satellite?
A. A sun synchronous satellite
B. A highly elliptical orbit satellite
C. A satellite in low energy operation mode
D. A satellite in low earth orbit

C. A licensed radio amateur who has been certified by the protocol developer
D. A licensed radio amateur who has registered for an access code from AMSAT

100

Computers make it easy to figure out when you can communicate via an amateur satellite. Computer
programs are available that not only tell you when a satellite is passing overhead, but also control an
antenna rotor and set the frequency of your transceiver.
T8B03
Which of the following are provided by satellite tracking programs?
A. Maps showing the real-time position of the satellite track over Earth
B. The time, azimuth, and elevation of the start, maximum altitude, and end of a pass

Two issues that you must deal with when communicating via satellites are Doppler shift and spin
fading.
T8B07
What is Doppler shift in reference to satellite communications?
A. A change in the satellite orbit
B. A mode where the satellite receives signals on one band and transmits on another
C. An observed change in signal frequency caused by relative motion between the
satellite and Earth station
D. A special digital communications mode for some satellites
T8B09
What causes spin fading of satellite signals?

Operating activities
There are many different ways to have fun with amateur radio. Contesting is one of them.
T8C03
What operating activity involves contacting as many stations as possible during a
specified period?
A. Simulated emergency exercises
B. Net operations
C. Public service events

C. Send only the minimum information needed for proper identification and the
contest exchange
D. All these choices are correct
Sending the minimum amount of information will help you make as many contacts as possible.
Information about a station's location is often part of the contest exchange. In the U.S., a station's state
or ARRL section is most often sent, but in VHF/UHF contests, stations often send each other their
grid locators.
T8C05
What is a grid locator?
A. A letter-number designator assigned to a geographic location
B. A letter-number designator assigned to an azimuth and elevation

102

C. A calibrated noise bridge
D. All these choices are correct

If the only radios that you have are VHF or UHF radios, you might want to look into EchoLink and
the Internet Radio Linking Project (IRLP). Both systems provide a way to communicate with amateurs
far away with a VHF or UHF transceiver by using Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP). The biggest
difference between IRLP and EchoLink is that a radio is required to access the IRLP network while you
can access the EchoLink network via a computer or mobile device. Because EchoLink has this feature,
you must prove that you are a licensed radio amateur before using EchoLink.
T8C08
What is the Internet Radio Linking Project (IRLP)?

monitored via the internet
D. A method of delivering voice communications over the internet using digital
techniques
T8C10
What is required before using the EchoLink system?
A. Complete the required EchoLink training
B. Purchase a license to use the EchoLink software

Stations that connect to EchoLink or IRLP are called nodes. You can access a particular node by
punching in the node number on a radio’s keypad. Pressing keys on the keypad generates DTMF (dual
tone, multi-frequency) signals. DTMF signals are comprised of a pair of tones which are unique for
each key.

103

T8C06

interference

Part 97 also contains rules about how repeater frequencies are assigned. This responsibility is assigned to
regional frequency coordinators, who are amateur radio operators who volunteer to do this work and are
selected by radio amateurs in that region.
T1A08 [97.3(a)(22)]
Which of the following entities recommends transmit/receive channels and other
parameters for auxiliary and repeater stations?

108

License classes
As you might expect, licensing is a big deal in the Amateur Radio Service. Your class of license
determines where you can operate, and in some cases, what modes you can operate and how much
power you can use.
While you will find Novice and Advanced Class licensees in the FCC database, only Technician,

After you pass the test, the FCC will send you an email notifying you how to pay the $35 license fee.
Once you pay that fee, they will assign you a call sign and enter your information into the license
database. The normal term for an FCC-issued amateur radio license is ten years. As soon as your
operator/station license grant appears in the FCC’s license database, you may transmit on the amateur
bands.

D. When the music is transmitted above 1280 MHz

Transmitting any codes whose specifications are not published or well-known is prohibited, except
when transmitting control commands to space stations or radio control craft. What this means in
practice is that encryption is not allowed on the amateur radio bands,
T1D03 [97.211(b), 97.215(b), 97.113(a)(4)]
When is it permissible to transmit messages encoded to obscure their meaning?

League (ARRL)
Currently, there are no countries that U.S. amateurs are prohibited from contacting, but I’m going to
guess that there are no licensed radio amateurs in North Korea.

Another big deal in amateur radio is the prohibition of being paid to operate an amateur radio station,
except in some very special circumstances. That doesn't mean that you can't make money from amateur
radio. I’m obviously making a few bucks by selling study guides, but I can't be paid for operating my
station or someone else's station.
T1D08 [97.113(a)(3)(iii)]
In which of the following circumstances may the control operator of an amateur
station receive compensation for operating that station?

broadcast station
D. All these choices are correct
T1D05 [97.113(a)(3)(ii)]
When may amateur radio operators use their stations to notify other amateurs of the
availability of equipment for sale or trade?
A. Never
B. When the equipment is not the personal property of either the station licensee, or the
control operator, or their close relatives
C. When no profit is made on the sale

When may an amateur station transmit without a control operator?
A. When using automatic control, such as in the case of a repeater
B. When the station licensee is away and another licensed amateur is using the station
C. When the transmitting station is an auxiliary station
D. Never
T1E11 [97.103(a)]
Who does the FCC presume to be the control operator of an amateur station, unless
documentation to the contrary is in the station records?
A. The station custodian
B. The third party participant
C. The person operating the station equipment
D. The station licensee
T1E03 [97.103(b)]
Who must designate the station control operator?

Two related concepts are the control point and control type. Part 97 defines three control types:
•

Local control. A station is said to be locally controlled when the control operator can directly
manipulate the controls of an amateur radio station.

•

Remote control. A station is said to be remotely controlled when the control operator indirectly
manipulates the operating controls of an amateur radio station through a control link, such as a
radio link, a telephone link, or an internet link.

•

Automatic control. A station is said to be automatically controlled if it uses devices and
procedures for control without the control operator being present at the control point.

The control point is where the control function is being performed. For example, the control point of a
station that is being locally controlled is wherever the station and operator are located. The control
point of a remotely-controlled station is wherever the control operator is located, which could be
anywhere in the world, if the operator is controlling the station over the internet.
T1E05 [97.3(a)(14)]
What is an amateur station’s control point?
A. The location of the station’s transmitting antenna
B. The location of the station’s transmitting apparatus
C. The location at which the control operator function is performed
D. The mailing address of the station licensee
T1E10 [97.3(a)(39)]

For some types of operations, using a tactical call is allowed. A tactical call describes the function of the
station or the location of a station, such as “Race Headquarters.” You do, however, still have to identify
using your FCC-assigned call sign every ten minutes or at the end of a communication.
T1F02 [97.119 (a)]

Third-party communications are communications on behalf of someone who is not the station licensee.
For example, if you have a friend over to your house and let him or her talk on your radio, that is a
third-party communication. These are entirely legal within the United States, but there are some
restrictions when you are in contact with an amateur station in a foreign country.
T1F08 [97.3(a)(47)]
What is the definition of third party communications?
A. A message from a control operator to another amateur station control operator on
behalf of another person
B. Amateur radio communications where three stations are in communications with one
another
C. Operation when the transmitting equipment is licensed to a person other than the
control operator
D. Temporary authorization for an unlicensed person to transmit on the amateur bands for
technical experiments
T1F07 (B) [97.115(a)(2)]
Which of the following restrictions apply when a non-licensed person is allowed to
speak to a foreign station using a station under the control of a licensed amateur
operator?
A. The person must be a U.S. citizen
B. The foreign station must be in a country with which the U.S. has a third party
agreement
C. The licensed control operator must do the station identification
D. All these choices are correct

Finally—and I do mean finally.
T1F01 [97.103(c)]

When must the station and its records be available for FCC inspection?
A. At any time ten days after notification by the FCC of such an inspection
B. At any time upon request by an FCC representative
C. At any time after written notification by the FCC of such inspection
D. Only when presented with a valid warrant by an FCC official or government agent
They’re not going to knock on your door at 3 a.m. some morning to take a look at your shack, but one
of your obligations as a licensee is to make your station and your records available when requested to do
so.

Well, that's it! We've covered all 413 questions in the Technician Class question pool. Now, you
should take some online practice tests, and when you're passing those regularly, find an exam session
and get your license. Good luck and 73!

Glossary
AC: alternating current. Alternating current is the name for current that reverses direction on a regular
basis. The power outlets in your home provide alternating current.
APRS: Automatic Packet Reporting System. APRS is digital communications system used by amateur
radio operators. While it is normally used for tracking the location of mobile stations, it can be used for
other purposes as well. For more information, go to http://www.aprs.org.
ARES: Amateur Radio Emergency Service. The Amateur Radio Emergency Service consists of licensed
amateurs who have voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment with their local ARES
leadership for communications duty in the public service when disaster strikes. For more information,
go to http://www.arrl.org/ares.
AM: amplitude modulation. The type of modulation that varies the amplitude of a radio signal in
accordance with the amplitude of a modulating signal. For more information, go to
http://www.pa2old.nl/files/am_fundamentals.pdf.
band plan: plan showing how frequencies within a particular amateur radio band are assigned to
different modes so that operators may avoid interfering with one another.
beam antenna: directional antenna.
CTCSS: Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System. A system that uses sub-audible tones, transmitted
along with the audio portion of a transmission to control whether or not a repeater will re-transmit a
signal. It is known by a number of different trade names, including Private Line® (PL) by Motorola. In
practice, it’s used to prevent nearby transmitters from inadvertently turning on repeaters.
CW: continuous wave. This is the operating mode amateur radio operators use when sending Morse
Code.
DC: direct current. Direct current is the name for current that never reverses direction.
Digital Mobile Radio: radio standard for time-division multiplexing two digital voice signals on a 12.5
KHz repeater channel.
DMR: Digital Mobile Radio
DTMF: dual-tone, multi-frequency. DTMF is a type of signaling used to send data over voice channels.
Its most common use in amateur radio is to allow users of handheld transceivers to send commands to
repeater systems. It is called DTMF because every time a user presses a keypad button a unique tone
consisting of two frequencies is transmitted. For more information, see
http://www.genave.com/dtmf.htm.
EchoLink: system that links amateur radio stations and computing devices using Voice over IP
(VOIP).
electromotive force (EMF): force that propels electric charge through a conductor or circuit; expressed
121

in volts (V).
FCC: Federal Communications Commission. This is the government body which sets the rules for
amateur radio in the U.S.
feed line: wire or cable that carries signals from a transmitter to an antenna or from an antenna to a
receiver.
FM: frequency modulation. The type of modulation normally used when operating on VHF and UHF
repeaters.
FT8: data transmission protocols designed for very weak signal communication.
HF: high frequency. The range of frequencies between 3 MHz and 30 MHz.
HT: handy-talky or handheld transceiver. “Handy Talky” is a Motorola trademark.
ITU: International Telecommunications Union. This is the international body which governs amateur
radio worldwide.
LSB: lower sideband. See SSB.
MFSK: multi-frequency shift keying. A type of modulation used to send digital information over a
radio channel.
PL: Private Line. See CTCSS.
PL-259: male connector often used to connect feedlines to a radio.
polarization: orientation of the electric field a radio wave.
PSK: phase shift keying. A method for sending digital information over a radio channel. A popular
amateur radio “digital mode” is PSK31, which uses PSK modulation and occupies only 31 Hz of
bandwidth.
PTT: push-to-talk
RACES: Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service. RACES is an amateur radio emergency
communications service created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the FCC.
RACES volunteers serve their respective jurisdictions pursuant to guidelines and mandates established
by local emergency management officials. See http://www.usraces.org/ for more information.
RIT: receiver incremental tuning. A control which allows a user to set the receive frequency of a
transceiver either slightly higher or slightly lower than the transmit frequency.
RF: radio frequency
SSB: single sideband. When a carrier is amplitude modulated, both upper and lower sidebands are
produced. This results in a signal that is 6 kHz wide. Since both sidebands carry the same information,
and the carrier carries no information, someone figured out that if they could filter out the carrier and
one of the sidebands, and put all the power into a single sideband, the efficiency of voice
122

communications would be much greater. Nearly all voice communications on the shortwave bands now
use SSB.
SWR: standing-wave ratio. The SWR of an antenna system is a measure of how closely the impedances
of the antenna and feedline match the output impedance of the transmitter.
talk group: virtual channel that connects amateur radio operators through a repeater or over the
internet.
VHF: very high frequency. The range of frequencies between 30 MHz and 300 MHz.
ULS: Universal Licensing System. The FCC’s Universal Licensing system contains information on all
FCC licensees, including amateur radio operators. For more information, go to http://www.fcc.gov/uls.
UHF: ultra high frequency. The range of frequencies between 300 MHz and 3000 MHz. 41
USB: upper sideband. See SSB.
VFO: variable frequency oscillator. VFOs are used to control the receiving and transmitting frequencies
of amateur radio equipment.
WSJT, WSJT-X: amateur radio software developed by Joe Taylor, K1JT, that supports weak-signal and
low-power digital communication modes, such as JT65, JT4, JT9, and QRA64 (EME); FSK441and
JTMS (meteor scatter); JT6M and ISCAT (ionospheric scatter), and FT8 and FT4.
