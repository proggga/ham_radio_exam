Radio Principles
Communications and information systems (CIS) are any systems whose
primary functions are to collect, process, or exchange information. The
fundamental requirement is to provide the Marine air-ground task force
(MAGTF) commander with a reliable, secure, fast, and flexible communications network.
Communications and information systems automate routine functions,
thereby freeing commanders and staffs to focus on those aspects of command and control that require experience, judgment, and intuition.
These systems and the personnel who install, operate, and maintain them
play a key role in the command and control of the MAGTF. Communications and informations systems support the commander and every staff
section in every phase of operations planning and execution.
These systems facilitate information flow throughout the MAGTF and
provide shared situational awareness, informed decisionmaking, and
rapid dissemination of decisions.
The success of the MAGTF in the modern battlespace depends on the
effective employment of communications and information systems.
Single-channel radio (SCR) is one of the most important components of
MAGTF CIS.

Section I. Theory and Propagation
BASIC COMPONENTS OF RADIO EQUIPMENT
The radio equipment for communication between two stations and the
path the signal follows through the air is called a radio link. A radio link
consists of seven components: the transmitter, power supply, transmission lines, transmitting antenna, propagation path, receiving antenna,
and receiver (see figure 1-1).
The transmitter generates a radio signal. The power supply (i.e., battery
or generator) supplies power for the operating voltage of the radio. The
transmission line delivers the signal from the transmitter to the antenna.

The transmitting antenna sends the radio signal into space toward the
receiving antenna. The path in space that the radio signal follows as it
goes to the receiving antenna is the propagation path. The receiving
antenna intercepts or receives the signal and sends it through a transmission line to the receiver. The receiver processes the radio signal so the
human ear can hear it.
When transmitting, the radio operator aims to provide the strongest possible signal at the site of the receiving station. The best possible signal is
that signal which will provide the greatest signal-to-noise ratio at the
receiving antenna.
To transmit the best possible signal, select or determine the—

RADIO WAVES

Propagation Velocity (Speed)
Radio waves travel near the surface of the Earth and radiate skyward at
various angles to the Earth’s surface. These electromagnetic waves
travel through space at the speed of light, approximately 300,000 kilometers (km) or 186,000 miles (mi) per second.
Wavelength
Wavelength is the distance between the crest of one wave and the crest
of the next wave (see figure 1-2 on page 1-4). It can also be the length of
one complete cycle of the waveform. It is also the distance traveled during one complete cycle. The length of the wave is always measured in
meters.

Radio Frequency
The frequency of a radio wave is the number of complete cycles that
occur in one second. The longer the cycle, the longer the wavelength and
the lower the frequency. The shorter the cycle, the shorter the wavelength and the higher the frequency. Frequency is measured and stated in
units called hertz (Hz). One cycle per second is stated as 1 hertz.
Because the frequency of a radio wave is very high, it is generally measured and stated in thousands of hertz (kilohertz [KHz]) or in millions of
hertz (megahertz [MHz]). One KHz is equal to 1,000 cycles per second,
and 1 MHz is equal to a million cycles per second. Sometimes frequencies are expressed in billions of hertz (gigahertz [GHz]). One GHz is
equal to a billion cycles per second.
For practical purposes, the velocity of a radio wave is considered to be
constant, regardless of the frequency or the amplitude of the transmitted
wave. Therefore, to find the frequency when the wavelength is known,
divide the velocity by the wavelength.

Figure 1-3. Electromagnetic Spectrum.

Within the radio frequency spectrum (see figure 1-3), radio frequencies
are divided into groups or bands of frequencies. The radio frequency
spectrum is part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Most tactical radio sets
operate within a 2- to 400-MHz range within the frequency spectrum.
Each frequency band has certain characteristics. The ranges and power
requirements shown in table 1-1 are for normal operating conditions
(proper siting and antenna orientation and correct operating procedures).
The ranges will change according to the condition of the propagation
medium and the transmitter output power.

Figure 1-4. Principle Paths of Radio Waves.

RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION
There are two principal paths by which radio waves travel from a transmitter to the receiver (See figure 1-4): ground wave—which travels
directly from the transmitter to the receiver and sky wave—which travels up to the ionosphere and is refracted (i.e., bent downward) back to
the Earth. Short-distance, ultrahigh frequency (UHF), and upper very
high frequency (VHF) transmissions are by ground waves. Long-distance, high frequency (HF) transmission is principally by sky waves.
Single-channel radio sets can use ground wave or sky wave propagation
for communications.
Ground Wave Propagation
Radio communications which use ground wave propagation do not use
or depend on waves that are refracted from the ionosphere (i.e., sky
waves). Ground wave propagation is affected by the electrical characteristics of the Earth and by the amount of diffraction (i.e., bending) of the

waves along the curvature of the Earth. The strength of the ground wave
at the receiver depends on the power output and frequency of the transmitter, the shape and conductivity of Earth along the transmission path,
and the local weather. The following paragraphs describe the components of a ground wave. See figure 1-5.
Direct Wave. The direct wave is that part of the radio wave which travels

directly from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. This part
of the wave is limited to the line of sight (LOS) distance between the
transmitting and receiving antennas, plus the small distance added by
atmospheric refraction and diffraction of the wave around the curvature
of the Earth. This distance can be extended by increasing the height of
the transmitting antenna, the receiving antenna, or both.
Ground Reflected Wave. The ground reflected wave is that portion of the

radio wave which reaches the receiving antenna after being reflected
from the surface of the earth. Cancellation of the radio signal can occur
when the ground reflected component and the direct wave component
arrive at the receiving antenna at the same time and are 180° out of phase
with each other.
Surface Wave. The surface wave, which follows the curvature of the

Earth, is that part of the ground wave which is affected by the conductivity and dielectric constant of the Earth.

Figure 1-6. Layers of the Ionosphere.

Sky Wave Propagation
Radio communications that use sky wave propagation depend on the
ionosphere to provide the signal path between the transmitting and
receiving antennas.
Ionospheric Structure. The ionosphere has four layers (see fig. 1-6). In

order of increasing heights and decreasing molecular densities, these
layers are labeled D, E, F1, and F2. During the day, when the rays of the

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 1-9
Sun are directed toward that portion of the atmosphere, all four layers
may be present. At night, the F1 and F2 layers seem to merge into a single F layer, and the D and E layers fade out. The actual number of layers,
their height above the Earth, and their relative intensity of ionization varies constantly. The following are layers of the ionosphere:
l

l

l

D—exists only during daylight hours and has little effect in bending
the paths of high frequency radio waves. The main effect of the D
layer is to attenuate high frequency waves when the transmission path
is in sunlit regions.
E—used during the day for high frequency radio transmission over
intermediate distances (less than 2,400 km [1,500 mi]). At night, the
intensity of the E layer decreases, and it becomes useless for radio
transmission.
F—exists at heights up to 380 kilometers (240 mi) above the Earth
and is ionized all the time. It has two well-defined layers (F1 and F2)
during the day, and one layer (i.e., F) during the night. At night, the F
layer remains at a height of about 260 kilometers (170 mi) and is useful for long-range radio communications (over 2,400 km [1,500 mi]).
The F2 layer is the most useful of all layers for long-range radio communications, even though its degree of ionization varies appreciably
from day to day.

Factors Affecting the Ionosphere. The movements of the Earth around

the Sun and changes in the Sun’s activity contribute to ionospheric variations. There are two main classes of variations: regular, which is predictable; and irregular, which occurs from abnormal behavior of the Sun.
Regular Variations of the Ionosphere. The regular variations are—
l
l
l
l

Daily—caused by the rotation of the Earth.
Seasonal—caused by the north and south progression of the Sun.
27-day—caused by the rotation of the Sun on its axis.
11-year—caused by the sunspot activity cycle going from maximum
to minimum, back to maximum levels of intensity.

1-10 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
Irregular Variations of the Ionosphere. The current status of the four reg-

ular variations must be anticipated when planning a communications
system. There are also unpredictable, irregular variations that must be
considered. They have a degrading effect (at times blocking communications) which cannot be controlled or compensated for at present. Some
irregular variations are—
l

l

l

Sporadic E. When it is excessively ionized, the E layer often blocks
out the reflections back from the higher layers. It can also cause unexpected propagation of signals hundreds of miles beyond the normal
range. This effect can occur at any time.
Sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID). A sudden ionospheric disturbance coincides with a bright solar eruption and causes abnormal ionization of the D layer. This effect causes total absorption of all
frequencies above approximately 1 MHz. It can occur without warning during daylight hours and last from a few minutes to several
hours. When SID occurs, receivers seem to go dead.
Ionospheric storms. During these storms, sky wave reception above
approximately 1.5 MHz shows low intensity and is subject to a type
of rapid blasting and fading called “flutter fading.” These storms may
last from several hours to days and usually extend over the entire
Earth.

Sunspots. Sunspots generate bursts of radiation that cause high levels of

ionization. The more sunspots, the greater the ionization. During periods
of low sunspot activity, frequencies above 20 MHz tend to be unusable
because the E and F layers are too weakly ionized to reflect signals back
to earth. At the peak of the sunspot cycle, however, it is not unusual to
have worldwide propagation on frequencies above 30 MHz.
Frequency Characteristics in the Ionosphere. The range of long-distance

radio transmission is determined primarily by the ionization density of
each layer. The higher the frequency, the greater the ionization density
required to reflect radio waves back to Earth. The upper (i.e., E and F)
layers reflect the higher frequencies because they are the most highly
ionized. The D layer, which is the least ionized, does not reflect frequencies above approximately 500 KHz. Thus, at any given time and for each

Radio Operator’s Handbook _____________________________ 1-11
ionized layer, there is an upper frequency limit at which radio waves sent
vertically upward are reflected back to Earth. This limit is called the critical frequency.
Radio waves directed vertically at frequencies higher than the critical
frequency pass through the ionized layer out into space. All radio waves
directed vertically into the ionosphere at frequencies lower than the critical frequency are reflected back to Earth. Radio waves used in communications are generally directed towards the ionosphere at some oblique
angle, called the angle of incidence. Radio waves at frequencies above
the critical frequency will be reflected back to Earth if transmitted at
angles of incidence smaller than a certain angle, called the critical angle.
At the critical angle and all angles larger than the critical angle the radio
waves will pass through the ionosphere if the frequency is higher than
the critical frequency. When the angle of transmission becomes smaller,
the radio waves will be reflected back to Earth.
Transmission Paths. The distance from the transmitting antenna to the

place where the sky waves first return to Earth is called the skip distance.
The skip distance is dependent on the angle of incidence, the operating
frequency, and the height and density of the ionosphere. The antenna
height, in relation to the operating frequency, affects the angle that transmitted radio waves strike and penetrate the ionosphere and then return to
Earth. This angle of incidence can be controlled to obtain the desired
area of coverage. Lowering the antenna will increase the angle of transmission and provide broad and even signal patterns in a large area. The
use of near-vertical transmission paths is known as near-vertical incidence sky wave (NVIS). Raising the antenna will lower the angle of
incidence. Lowering the angle of incidence can produce a skip zone in
which no usable signal can be received. This area is bounded by the
outer edge of usable ground wave propagation and the point nearest the
antenna at which the sky wave returns to Earth. In most communications
situations, the skip zone is not a desirable condition. However, low
angles of incidence make long-distance communications possible.
When a transmitted wave is reflected back to the surface of the Earth,
part of its energy is absorbed by the Earth. The remainder of its energy is
reflected back into the ionosphere to be reflected back again. This means

1-12 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
of transmission—by alternately reflecting the radio wave between the
ionosphere and the Earth—is called hops, and it enables radio waves to
be received at great distances from the point of origin.
Maximum Usable and Lowest Usable Frequencies. There is a maximum

frequency at which a radio wave will return to Earth at a given distance
when a given ionized layer and a transmitting antenna with a fixed angle
of radiation is used. This frequency is called the maximum usable frequency (MUF). It is the monthly median of the daily highest frequency
that is predicted for sky wave transmission over a particular path at a
particular hour of the day. The MUF is always higher than the critical
frequency because the angle of incidence is less than 90°. If the distance
between the transmitter and the receiver is increased, the maximum
usable frequency will also increase. Radio waves lose some of their
energy through absorption by the D layer and the portion of the E layer
of the ionosphere at certain transmission frequencies.
The total absorption is less and communications are more satisfactory as
higher frequencies are used up to the level of the MUF. The absorption
rate is greatest for frequencies ranging from approximately 500 KHz to 2
MHz during the day. At night, the absorption rate decreases for all frequencies. As the frequency of transmission over any sky wave path is
decreased from high to low frequencies, a frequency will be reached at
which the received signal just overrides the level of atmospheric and
other radio noise interference. This is called the lowest useful frequency
(LUF) because frequencies lower than the LUF are too weak for useful
communications. The LUF also depends on the power output of the
transmitter as well as the transmission distance. When the LUF is greater
than the MUF, no sky wave transmission is possible.

Radio Operator’s Handbook _____________________________ 1-13
Section II. Modulation and Single Side Band
Transmission
Radio communications equipment is used primarily to transmit voice
and data. Although sound can be converted to audio frequency electrical
energy, it is not practical to transmit it in this energy form through the
Earth’s atmosphere by electromagnetic radiation. For example, efficient
transmission of a 20-hertz audio signal would require an antenna almost
8,000 kilometers (5,000 mi) long. This would not apply when radio frequency electrical energy is used to carry the intelligence. When radio
frequency electrical energy is used, great distances can be covered; efficient antennas for radio frequencies are of practical lengths; and antenna
power losses are at reasonable levels.
The frequency of the radio wave affects its propagation characteristics.
In the low frequency band (.03 to.3 MHz), the ground wave is very useful for communications over great distances. The ground wave signals
are quite stable and show little seasonal variation. In the medium frequency band (.3 to 3.0 MHz), the range of the ground wave varies from
about 24 kilometers (15 mi) at 3 MHz, to about 640 kilometers (400 mi)
at the lowest frequencies of this band. Sky wave reception is possible
during the day or night at any of the lower frequencies in this band. At
night, the sky wave is receivable at distances up to 12,870 kilometers
(8,000 mi). In the high frequency band (3 to 30 MHz), the range of the
ground wave decreases as frequency increases, and the sky waves are
greatly influenced by ionospheric considerations.
In the very high frequency band (30 to 300 MHz), there is no usable
ground wave and only slight refraction of sky waves by the ionosphere
at the lower frequencies. The direct wave provides communications if
the transmitting and receiving antennas are elevated high enough above
the surface of the Earth.
In the ultrahigh frequency band (300 to 3,000 MHz), the direct wave
must be used for all transmissions. Communications are limited to a
short distance beyond the horizon. Lack of static and fading in these
bands makes line of sight reception very satisfactory. Antennas that are
highly directional can be used to concentrate the beam of radio frequency (RF) energy, thus, increasing the signal intensity.

1-14 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
MODULATION
Both amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) transmitters produce RF carriers. The carrier is a wave of constant amplitude,
frequency, and phase which can be modulated by changing its amplitude, frequency, or phase. Thus, the RF carrier “carries” intelligence by
being modulated. Modulation is the process of superimposing intelligence (voice or coded signals) on the carrier.
Amplitude Modulation
Amplitude modulation is the variation of the RF power output of a transmitter at an audio rate. In other words, the RF energy increases and
decreases in power according to the audio frequencies superimposed on
the carrier signal.
When audio frequency signals are superimposed on the radio frequency
carrier signal, additional RF signals are generated. These additional frequencies are equal to the sum of, and the difference between the audio
frequencies and the radio frequency used. For example, assume a 500KHz carrier is modulated by a 1-KHz audio tone. Two new frequencies
are developed, one at 501 KHz (the sum of 500 KHz and 1 KHz) and the
other at 499 KHz (the difference between 500 KHz and 1 KHz). If a
complex audio signal is used instead of a single tone, two new frequencies will be set up for each of the audio frequencies involved. The new
frequencies resulting from superimposing an audio frequency (AF) signal on an RF signal are called side bands.
When the RF carrier is modulated by complex tones such as speech,
each separate frequency component of the modulating signal produces
its own upper and lower side band frequencies. The side band that contains the sum of the RF and AF signals is called the upper side band. The
side band that contains the difference between the RF and AF signals is
called the lower side band.
The space occupied by a carrier and its associated side bands in
the radio frequency spectrum is called a channel. In amplitude modulation, the width of the channel (bandwidth) is equal to twice the highest

Radio Operator’s Handbook _____________________________ 1-15
modulating frequency. For example, if a 5,000 KHz (5 MHz) carrier is
modulated by a band of frequencies ranging from 200 to 5,000 cycles (.2
to 5 KHz), the upper side band extends from 5,000.2 to 5,005 KHz. The
lower side band extends from 4,999.8 KHz to 4,995 KHz. Thus, the
bandwidth is the difference between 5,005 KHz and 4,995 KHz, a total
of 10 KHz.
Frequency Modulation
Frequency modulation is the process of varying the frequency (rather
than the amplitude) of the carrier signal in accordance with the variations of the modulating signals. The amplitude or power of the FM carrier does not vary during modulation.
The frequency of the carrier signal when it is not modulated is called the
center or rest frequency. When a modulating signal is applied to the
carrier, the carrier signal will move up and down in frequency, away
from the center or rest frequency.
The amplitude of the modulating signal determines how far away from
the center frequency the carrier will move. This movement of the carrier
is called deviation; how far the carrier moves is called the amount of
deviation. During reception of the FM signal, the amount of deviation
determines the loudness or volume of the signal.
The FM signal leaving the transmitting antenna is constant in amplitude
but varies in frequency according to the audio signal. As the signal travels to the receiving antenna, it picks up natural and man-made electrical
noises that cause amplitude variations in the signal. All of these undesirable amplitude variations are amplified as the signal passes through successive stages of the receiver until the signal reaches a part of the
receiver called the limiter. The limiter is unique to FM receivers as is the
discriminator.
The limiter eliminates the amplitude variations in the signal, then passes
it on to the discriminator which is sensitive to variations in the frequency
of the RF wave. The resultant constant amplitude, frequency-modulated
signal is then processed by the discriminator circuit which changes the

1-16 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
frequency variations into corresponding voltage amplitude variations.
These voltage variations reproduce the original modulating signal in a
headset, loudspeaker, or teletypewriter. Frequency modulation is generally used by radiotelephone transmitters operating in the VHF and
higher frequency bands.
SINGLE SIDE BAND TRANSMISSION
The intelligence of an AM signal is contained solely in the side bands.
Each side band contains all the intelligence needed for communications.
Therefore, one side band and the carrier signal can be eliminated. This is
the principle on which single side band (SSB) communications is based.
Although both side bands are generated within the modulation circuitry
of the SSB radio set, the carrier and one side band are removed before
any signal is transmitted.
The side band that is higher in frequency than the carrier is called the
upper side band (USB). The side band that is lower in frequency than the
carrier is called the lower side band (LSB). Either side band can be used
for communications as long as both the transmitter and the receiver are
adjusted to the same side band. Most SSB equipment operates in the
USB mode. The transmission of only one side band leaves open that portion of the RF spectrum normally occupied by the other side band of an
AM signal. This allows more emitters to be used within a given frequency range.
Single side band transmission is used in applications when it is desired

Single-Channel Radio
SINGLE-CHANNEL RADIO COMMUNICATIONS
EQUIPMENT
Single-channel radio is the principal means of communications support
for MAGTF maneuver units. SCR communications equipment is easy to
operate. The networks are easily established, rapidly reconfigured, and,
most importantly, easily maintained on the move. SCR provides secure
voice communications and supports limited data information exchange.
SCR in the VHF and UHF bands is normally limited to line of sight. In
the HF band, SCR can support long-range communications. SCR satellite communications (SATCOM) provides mobility, flexibility, and ease
of operation with unlimited range. Limitations of SCR include susceptibility to enemy electronic warfare (i.e., cosite, terrain, and atmospheric
interference); the requirement for close coordination and detailed planning (i.e., a need for common timing, frequency, and equipment); and
limited spectrum availability. The latter is particularly critical in the case
of SATCOM.
MAGTF SCR equipment is fielded in many configurations and includes
hand-held, manpack, vehicle-mounted, bench-mounted, and sheltered
radios. These radios operate in simplex and half-duplex modes. The
most widely employed tactical radios provide integrated communications security (COMSEC) and jam resistance through frequency hopping. Tactical SCRs operate in the three military radio frequency bands
shown in Table 2-1 on page 1-2.

HIGH FREQUENCY RADIO
HF radio equipment is capable of both long- and short-range secure
voice and data communications. Data communications capability is typically limited to rates of 2.4 kilobits per second (kbps). Data transmission
requires modems specifically designed for operation in this band of the
radio spectrum. The AN/PRC-104 is capable of remote operation by
using the analog AN/GRA-39B radio remote control. See fig. 2-1.

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 2-3

Figure 2-1. AN/PRC-104 HF Radio.

High frequency communications are capable of traveling around the
world under the right conditions. This accounts for the large number of
signals and noise in the receiver (e.g., thunderstorms). Conversely, the
HF transmission may be intercepted and traced by the enemy who is
many hundreds of miles away. VHF and UHF communications are normally limited to line of sight; therefore, their range is restricted. UHF
transmissions may also be used in satellite communications, increasing
ranges to thousands of miles.
High Frequency Radio Employment Considerations.
The primary advantage of using HF radio is its capability to provide
long-range, over the horizon (OTH) communication. Successful data
communications over the HF range depends on several factors: equipment siting, proper equipment grounding, types of antennas used, and
other considerations such as tactical employment of radio equipment,
path assessment and analysis, and frequency planning and assignment.
When commercial data terminal equipment (DTE) is used, users
employing HF radio equipment need to be aware of radio interference
and potential shock hazards that can easily affect unprotected DTE.
Whenever possible, HF radio equipment should be remoted from DTE.

High Frequency Radio Environmental Limitations
The primary limiting factors when using HF radios are frequency allocation and management and bandwidth availability. Frequency allocation
and management is concerned with frequency, time of day, time of year,
and location. The ability to reflect HF radio waves off the ionosphere to
a distant location is in a constant state of flux because of activity in the
ionosphere. The Sun’s radiation causes disturbances in the ionosphere,
with most changes taking place in what is known as the F layer (see
chapter 1 for more details). Sunrise and sunset can be the most difficult
times for HF communications. The F layer splits into two separate layers
around sunrise and recombines into one layer around sunset. These splits
affect transmission distances as the area “skipped over” increases and
decreases. At times, solar storms can eliminate all HF communications.
HF transmission paths must be constantly monitored to achieve a
dependable HF link. HF radio data communications capabilities are limited by the bandwidth that is imposed by legal constraints and the physics of the spectrum. The bandwidth available in the HF spectrum limits
the channel bandwidth, which limits data throughput.
High Frequency Propagation
There are two modes of propagation in HF: ground wave and sky wave.
See figure 2-2.
Ground Wave. Ground wave propagation involves the transmission of a

signal along the surface of the ground. The maximum ground wave
range for most tactical HF communications is about 20 to 30 kilometers
(12 to 22 miles) for manpack equipment and 80 to 100 kilometers for
high-power vehicular and van equipment. The range may be decreased
by heavy vegetation (e.g., Camp Lejeune), mountainous terrain (e.g.,
Camp Pendleton), or dry desert soil (e.g., Twenty-nine Palms). A ground
wave circuit will generally be free of fading and may last for the entire
24-hour period without the need to change frequencies.

Sky Wave. Beyond this range, it is necessary to communicate by sky

wave. Sky wave propagation involves the bending of the signal by the
ionosphere. Frequencies are very important, as those above a certain
value will not bend back to earth but will punch through the ionosphere
into outer space. On the other hand, lower frequencies are noisier and
become absorbed by the ionosphere. The reflective nature of the ionosphere will change when sunlight hits it each day. As a result, at least
two frequencies are usually required during a 24-hour period: a low,
night frequency and a higher, day frequency.
Skip Zone
A skip zone is where no signals will be received from a particular transmitter for a particular frequency. Skip zones are formed when the nearest
point at which a sky wave is received is beyond the furthest point
at which a ground wave is received. By using an antenna with a high

2-6 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
radiation take-off angle (i.e., the angle measured from the Earth’s surface to horizon up to the direction of propagation towards the ionosphere), HF radio waves can be bounced off the ionosphere and come
back to earth closer than they can with more commonly used antennas.
This can cause the skip zone to disappear if the waves do not punch
through.
The use of high radiation take-off angles is called near-vertical incident
sky wave (NVIS) communications. The limit of the effective range of
NVIS communications is usually about 300 miles. NVIS communications require a horizontally polarized antenna and are done over frequencies between 2 and 12 MHz. Launch angles can be changed by altering
the antenna’s height above ground, but for most tactical applications
one-quarter wavelength above ground is sufficient. NVIS communications are particularly useful because they can be transmitted from moving vehicles. Used correctly, NVIS provides reliable, continuous
communications beyond the range of HF ground wave and VHF and
UHF line of sight. Multipath interference occurs when both the sky wave
and the ground wave signals from the transmitter arrive at different
times at the receiver. See figure 2-3. More detailed information on HF
propagation and antennas may be found in MCRP 6-22D, Antenna
Handbook.
VERY HIGH FREQUENCY RADIO
The primary MAGTF VHF radio is the single-channel ground and airborne radio system (SINCGARS). SINCGARS is a family of lightweight combat radios that serves as the primary means of
communications for command and control and fire support on the battlefield. SINCGARS is the standard VHF-FM tactical radio for the Marine
Corps, replacing the AN/PRC-77 and the AN/VRC-12 family. The system provides high security against threat electronic warfare (EW) by
using frequency hopping with integrated COMSEC. It is capable of
voice and data transmission (up to 16 kbps under optimum conditions
and over limited distances) over the VHF-FM frequency range of 30 to
87.975 MHz. See MCRP 6-22A, Talk II SINCGARS Multiservice Communications Procedures for the Single-Channel Ground and Airborne
Radio System, for more details.

There are seven different SINCGARS configurations available, depending on the requirements of the user. These configurations include the
manpack AN/PRC-119 (see figure 2-4 on page 2-8), typically used in
infantry operations, and vehicle-mounted variants. The radio provides
voice communications ranges of up to 8 km for the manpack and 35 km
for vehicular configurations. SINCGARS is capable of remote operation
by using the analog AN/GRA-39B radio remote control, the digital
HYX-57 wire-line ADAPTER, or the digital C-11561 (C)/U remote control unit (RCU).
The SINCGARS radio has undergone a systems improvement program
(SIP). This radio is referred to as the SINCGARS SIP. The primary
improvements relate to the data transmission capabilities of the system.
A forward error correction appliqué was implemented in the receiver
and/or transmitter, and a new packet data mode was created to better
support packet networks. In addition, an improved channel access protocol was added, which optimizes data throughput performance while minimizing impact on voice communications on the same SINCGARS
channel.

2-8 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C

Figure 2-4. AN/PRC-119 SINCGARS Radio.

THE SINCGARS SIP radio is also available in a downsized version—
the result of an advanced systems improvement program (ASIP). This
radio is referred to as the SINCGARS ASIP. This radio will retain all the
functionality of the full-size SIP radio but is half the size. It weighs 7.6
pounds (including the battery). The radio is interchangeable with previous SINCGARS versions, including the capability to be mounted in
older vehicular adapter assemblies. A new feature of the SINCGARS
ASIP provides a retransmission capability while operating in the packet
data mode and will also employ a new, fast-channel access protocol for
improved operations in shared voice or data nets.
The AN/ARC-210 multipurpose radio supports single-channel air-to-air,
air-to-ground, and ground-to-air communications in tactical Navy and
Marine Corps fixed- and rotary wing aircraft. It can transmit and receive
VHF-FM, VHF-AM, and UHF signals. It is compatible with SINCGARS, HAVE QUICK, and HAVE QUICK II frequency hopping UHF
radios, and it can accept 25 preset, single-channel frequencies. The AN/
ARC-210 requires a TSEC/KY-58 encryption device to encrypt transmissions and decrypt received signals.

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 2-9
Hand-Held Very High Frequency Radios
Radio operators may have the opportunity to use various commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) VHF radios in the Fleet Marine Force (FMF). All
of these radios have been open-purchased by the user units and are not
part of the official Marine Corps table of equipment. Therefore, they
have not been assigned a table of authorization material control number
(TAMCN).
These hand-held radios are typically small, lightweight, battery-powered
equipment which provides clear (and in some cases secure) voice communications on up to 100 different channels. Some models come with
headsets and microphones. Hand-held radios are mostly used at the
infantry-squad level or in maritime prepositioning force (MPF) offloads.
Very High Frequency Radio Employment Considerations
Operator maintenance of the radio equipment, antennas, cable assemblies, and equipment grounding as well as proper planning and selection
are essential to reliable communications. Frequency separation, radio
antenna separation, remote rekeying when using COMSEC, and power
output are significant employment factors. SINCGARS may be limited
to the single-channel mode when operating with some Navy ships. When
SINCGARS is employed in the frequency hopping mode, the following
operating factors need to be taken into account: hopset (i.e., frequency
segment allocation), net sych time and mission date, antenna placement
(cosite interference is more of a concern than in the single-channel operating mode), and power setting. SINCGARS radios configured for different hopsets that dial into the same numbered net will not be able to
communicate. MCRP 6-22A provides detailed information on the
employment of SINCGARS.
VHF SCR is the primary communications system for combat and combat support units while on the move. The predominant mode of operation
is secure voice. However, use of VHF radio for data communications
will increase with the fielding of tactical information systems at the battalion level and below. Small, hand-held VHF radios are used at the
small-unit level in the MAGTF. These radios are often commercial items

2-10 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
that lack compatibility with SINCGARS and do not have integrated
COMSEC. Their use should be governed accordingly.
Very High Frequency Radio Environmental Limitations
The primary limiting factors when using VHF radios are range and frequency availability. VHF radios can provide reliable communications
for ranges of up to 10 miles, depending on the equipment operating constraints and the operating environment. Unit location must be considered
when employing radios that operate in the VHF spectrum. Most circuits
are limited to radio line of sight, known as four-thirds earth curvature.
VHF radio signals essentially follow the curvature of the earth to a distance that is approximately one-third greater than the distance to the
horizon. Foliage interferes with VHF signals and may reduce normal
operating ranges to significantly less than 10 miles.
Very High Frequency Propagation
Radios in the SINCGARS family are the principal VHF transceivers
used by the Marine Corps. The mode of communications used in this
range is frequently referred to as frequency modulation. VHF will
extend slightly beyond line of sight due to diffraction or bending of the
signal by the atmosphere (see fig. 2-5). At frequencies in the 30-MHz
range, VHF will often act like HF ground wave. The range of reliable
communications is generally no more than 15 to 20 kilometers (9.3 to
12.4 mi) under normal field conditions for manpack equipment. Vehiclemounted equipment may communicate farther because of higher transmitter power and better antennas.

VHF LOS can also be plagued by multipath interference when the direct
ray and a reflected ray traveling over a slightly longer path combine at
the receiver antenna so that they periodically cancel or reinforce each
other (see fig. 2-6). The signal fades in and out over a period of time as a
result. Fading is not as great a problem with immobile equipment
because corrective action can be taken, but fading can cause significant
problems when one or more of the units are mobile.

ULTRAHIGH FREQUENCY RADIO
Military UHF radio equipment operates in the 116 to 150 MHz upperVHF frequency range and the 225 to 400 MHz military UHF radio spectrum. MAGTF UHF radio sets such as the AN/PRC-113 (see figure 2-7
on page 2-12) are capable of data communications at 16 kbps under optimal conditions. MAGTF ground and airborne UHF radios incorporate
the HAVE QUICK Electronic Counter-Counter Measures capability and
operate in single-channel and frequency hopping modes. The HAVE
QUICK UHF radio is capable of remote operation by using the AN/
GRA-39B or HYX-57.
Ultrahigh Frequency Radio Employment Considerations
UHF radios are used for forward air control (FAC) ground-to-air communication. Line of sight between radios is critical for reliable communications. Significant range differences are encountered between UHF
radios employed for ground-to-air and ground-to-ground communications. Greater range is achieved when employed from ground-to-air
because of the increased line of sight. When UHF radios are employed in

2-12 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C

Figure 2-7. AN/PRC-113. UHF Radio.

the frequency hopping mode, the following operating factors must be
understood for proper operation: hopset, time of day, antenna placement,
and power setting.
Ultrahigh Frequency Radio Environmental Limitations
The primary limiting factor when using UHF radios is range (i.e., critical
line of sight). Critical line of sight can be described as “what you see is
what you get.” As long as the radio’s antenna has optical line of sight to
another radio’s antenna, the two will be able to transmit and receive. For
this reason, UHF radios are used primarily in air-to-ground communications.

Radio Operator’s Handbook _____________________________ 2-13
Ultrahigh Frequency-Tactical Satellite
The AN/PSC-5 is a portable, battery-operated, half-duplex UHF transceiver. It is employed for long-range communications. It weighs approximately 14 pounds including antenna and batteries. The AN/PSC-5
provides two-way voice and data communications by satellite. It operates on the UHF frequency band of 225- to 400-MHz range. It provides
2,400 to 16,000-bits per second (bps) data rate, depending on mode setting. Only one operator is required to operate it. The United States
Marine Corps UHF tactical SATCOM system supports and augments
the high precedence command and control and common-user, singlechannel requirements of a Marine air-ground task force and its major
subordinate headquarters.
The space segments used by the AN/PSC-5 are the Fleet Satellite Communications, leased satellite communications, and UHF follow-on satellites. All the satellites are located in geosynchronous orbits and permit
interconnections among mobile, ground terminals. The one-way distance
to servicing satellites is approximately 25,000 miles, resulting in a
round-trip propagation delay of approximately one-quarter of a second.
The shape of the satellite footprints is roughly circular but elongated
from north to south. This is caused by the angle at which the signal hits
the Earth’s surface and by the curvature of the Earth’s surface.
Multiple-access schemes can operate either with fixed-channel assignments to the various users or with channels being assigned in varying
fashion according to demand. The latter is called demand assigned multiple access (DAMA). With demand assignment, the user makes a channel request, and a channel is allocated after a brief time lag. The DAMA
scheme of operation is employed on UHF-tactical satellite (TACSAT) to
share available channels more efficiently. The radio systems are compatible with the KY-57 (wideband mode only), the KY-99 and ANDVT
(narrowband mode only), and the KG-84C (wideband or narrowband)
COMSEC equipment. This radio equipment is also capable of remote
operations by using the AN/GRA-39B (narrowband mode) or HYX-57
(wide-band mode).

2-14 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C

Figure 2-8. AN/PSC-5 UHF TACSAT Radio.
TACSAT Radio Employment Considerations. Because of TACSAT’s lim-

ited availability, the MAGTF employs TACSAT primarily to support
critical, long-range communications requirements (e.g., communications
support for deep reconnaissance operations or connectivity to the tactical
echelon of a MEU[SOC] when deployed ashore). The AN/PSC-5 is the
primary DAMA-capable, TACSAT radio available to the MAGTF (see
fig. 2-8). TACSAT limitations include the competition for available frequency resources and channel time on the satellite. If only narrow band
channels are available, channel-data rates are limited to 2,400 bps. Channel congestion, noise, and network saturation will affect the information
flow on satellite channels and will require a significant reduction in the
data transmission rates to sustain data communications. Transmit power
selection can be critical. Increasing the transmit power can decrease net
effectiveness. Larger directional antennas provide increased signal gain,
which increases the transmitted signal power. Antennas for these systems are lightweight and fragile and, therefore, require constant maintenance and inspection for proper operation. Satellites are shared
resources. Exact frequency, bandwidth, and power of every carrier transmitted through the satellite is strictly controlled by a higher authority.
TACSAT Radio Environmental Limitations. The primary environmental

limitations on TACSAT radios are signal propagation delay, location on
the Earth, terrain masking, and weather effects. Timing between DTE
can be a critical factor in SATCOM because the satellite, acting
as a relay between radios, is about 25,000 miles away. There is

Radio Operator’s Handbook _____________________________ 2-15
approximately a one-fourth second propagation delay between sending
and receiving stations. This delay can interfere with systems that automatically retransmit if an acknowledgment is not received after a very
short time-out period. As unit location changes, the “look angle” (i.e.,
angle above the horizon) to the satellite can affect net reliability. The
orbit of a satellite allows it to cover a certain footprint on the earth. Satellites in equatorial orbit can cover large portions of the Earth, both north
and south of the equator, but as the user moves closer to the Earth’s
poles, the TACSAT terminal may exceed the satellite footprint. This will
cause intermittent or lost communications. Terrain can also have this
effect by interfering with the satellite and TACSAT terminal line of
sight. Thunderstorms, heavy snowstorms, and hail also affect satellite
transmissions by damaging antennas and changing the electromagnetic
environment.
Ultrahigh Frequency Propagation
UHF frequency propagation is used for ground-to-air, air-to-air, satellite,
and tactical multi-channel communications. Communications are limited
to LOS but may extend for more than 500 kilometers as long as the aircraft is high enough to be within LOS (see fig. 2-9). It is even possible
for UHF communications ranges to a satellite to be more than 35,000
kilometers.

DATA COMMUNICATIONS
SCR can also transmit and receive data by using terminal devices such
as the digital message system (DMS)—previously called and more commonly known as the digital communications terminal (DCT)—and the
tactical communications interface module (TCIM). The DCT, data

2-16 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
automated communications terminal (DACT), and the TCIM are critical
in enabling data communications at the tactical level over SCRs.
Digital Message System-AN/PSC-2
The DMS-AN/PSC-2 is a hand-held communications device that can be
operated with either a standard military radio or telephone field wire
equipment. The DMS is used to compose, edit, display, transmit, and
receive information. By menu selection, formatted text, free text, and
digitized map messages are transmitted over tactical communications
equipment. DMS is being used directly for air support, fire support
coordination, reconnaissance, medical evacuation, and other functions.
DMS uses a burst transmission capability which reduces the vulnerability to enemy radio direction finding and jamming.
Data Automated Communications Terminal
The DACT is a small, tactical computer and communications terminal
which gives users the capability to receive, process, and transmit various
messages, to include text and symbology, used by tactical data systems.
The DACT will effectively replace the DCT when it achieves full operational capability in FY 03, and it will provide much greater functionality
below battalion levels. This will include an embedded global positioning
system (GPS) receiver, the ability to share a common picture of the battlespace, automated data exchange, and MAGTF command, control,
communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) network connectivity. The DACT will be transportable by foot-mobile Marines and
mounted in tactical or armored vehicles.
Tactical Communications Interface Module
The TCIM provides the communications link between the tactical computers of the communications and information systems within the
MAGTF and the local and wide area networks, switched backbone
(SBB), and radio nets. There are two versions of the TCIM card: an
internal personal computer asynchronous transfer card to mount directly
in the computer, and an external version with the card mounted in a portable chassis. TCIM software was developed for open-systems architectures. Small computer systems interfaces (SCSI) provide interoperability
between the TCIM and other Marine Corps computers.

Chapter 3

Equipment Siting and Grounding
Techniques
Two factors play an important role in equipment siting: optimum communications and camouflage. It is often difficult to find communications
sites which are hidden from enemy view, fire, and direction finding and
afford good communications connectivity. The ideal location for a radio
antenna is as far away from cover as possible, such as a bare mountain
top or in the middle of a large field. However, this goes against the commander’s tactical requirement for troops and equipment to be camouflaged and concealed as much as possible. Therefore, planning the
location of equipment must be detailed to achieve the best results. See
Appendix A for a review on topographical maps and grid coordinates.
HIGH FREQUENCY
In the presence of hills (without large trees), the following guidelines for
ground wave links should be used:
l

l

Locate HF antennas just below the top of the hill in the direction of
desired communications. Often the signal will be greater below than
on the top. This will also minimize interference and/or jamming from
the opposite direction.
Move the antenna back from the hill if a hill is between the operator
and the distant station with which the operator wishes to communicate. The signal strength can vary widely in the region immediately
behind a hill. If it is necessary to set up behind a hill, then it may also
be necessary to set up a variety of antennas located at different distances from the hilltop to see which one offers the best performance.

Long-distance, HF sky wave signals of more than several hundred kilometers are often best transmitted and received at angles just above the
horizon level. Obstacles on the horizon will cause the signal to travel a

higher path angle and may reduce the circuit reliability as a result (see
fig. 3-1). Wire fences between the operator and the horizon will also
lessen the chances of getting through (see fig. 3-2).
An HF ground wave signal will follow the terrain much better than
higher frequency signals. It will be weakened by trees (more so when

(see fig. 3-3).
VERY HIGH FREQUENCY AND ULTRAHIGH FREQUENCY
Obstacles such as trees, buildings, and hills between a transmitter and
receiver will weaken the signal or stop it. Aircraft flying along the path
will also interfere with reception (see fig. 3-4). A clear signal path

between the transmitter and the intended receiver, especially for LOS
communications, is preferred. The antenna must be positioned as high as
possible to overcome obstacles, especially if communication is in the
direction of trees or buildings (see fig. 3-5). Keep equipment as far back
as possible from obstacles in the direction of the signal path to prevent
interference or damage to equipment.
In some situations, solid obstacles may actually improve a link by providing a sharper surface to diffract over or reflect from (see fig. 3-6).

Figure 3-7. Reflection off Spherical Water Tower.

Under certain conditions, spherical water towers and walls of buildings
(facing the proper direction) may enable communication around interfering terrain or vegetative obstacles (see fig. 3-7).
Transmitting over water allows VHF to go farther, but fading may occur.
If communicating over water is unavoidable, and fading occurs, the signal may be improved by raising or lowering the antenna. The antenna
may also be positioned so a hill or rise is between it and the water but not
high enough to block the LOS to the other antenna (see fig. 3-8).

Nothing is more compromising to a unit’s location than an antenna farm
stretched along a ridge line (see fig. 3-9). The enemy will realize that a
major command post is nearby. The advantage of placing an antenna on
a ridge line is the ability to talk in many directions without land being in
the way. If communication is needed in only one direction—away from
the enemy—put some terrain shielding between the antenna farm and
the enemy (see figures 3-10 and 3-11). This way, the enemy won’t be
able to intercept communications or jam circuits as easily. However, it’s
not always necessary to talk from hilltop to hilltop. Talking from hillside
to hillside or along the valley floor may be a better option in some
instances. The enemy will certainly have a harder time locating a unit
this way.

PATH

ENEMY

Figure 3-11. Terrain Shielding.

The body can act as an antenna and affect the quality of the radio signal,
particularly backpack and hand-held VHF sets with short antennas. The
effect of the body on signal strength depends on frequency, antenna
length, and the position of the antenna or set relative to the operator’s
body (see fig. 3-12 on page 3-8).
Backpack Sets (AN/PRC-119)
Maximum radiation (i.e., best performance) is to the front when the set is
on the operator’s back with a 3-foot whip antenna. The operator should
then try facing in the direction of distant communications. This effect is
most noticeable at frequencies greater than 50 MHz.
When the set is on the ground, and the operator is very close to the set,
maximum radiation will probably occur through the operator’s body. If
the operator is a couple of feet away, the operator may act as a reflector
and either improve or interfere with the signal.
Hand-Held Sets (AN/PRC-68)
The antenna of the hand-held AN/PRC-68 is much smaller than the AN/
PRC-119’s, and the operator’s body affects directional characteristics to

3-8 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C

a greater extent, particularly when the antenna is lowered. This radio
will normally be in the front jacket pocket, and best performance is then
over the back. The higher frequencies are strongly affected when the
antenna is lowered. Holding the radio in hand a few inches away from
the body will modify the radiation pattern and can substantially lower
performance to the sides at the higher frequencies. The directional characteristics of the antenna-body combination can be used to some advantage in reducing interference arriving from directions other than that of
the signal. Trial and error is necessary to make this judgment.
VHF Siting
Position the antenna to reflect the directive pattern away from the wall or
fence in the intended direction of communication when using VHF
antennas near a metal-walled building or high, metal fence. For frequencies between 30 and 50 MHz, the antenna should be placed approximately 2 meters (6.5 feet) away; between 50 and 88 MHz, no more than
1 meter (3.2 feet) away. Communications may be reduced if antennas are
placed more than 2 meters from the radio. The distance may be varied a

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 3-9
foot or so in each direction, while receiving, to find the position where
the signal is the strongest when setting up the equipment. If frequencies
are changed later, the optimum position will have to be redetermined at
that time by the same method.
UHF Siting
At UHF and (to a much lesser degree) VHF frequencies, if an operator
cannot see a person, then they probably cannot communicate—especially in heavy vegetation. Often, the signal has to travel up to the tops of
the trees and move along the treetops and down to the receiver (see fig.
3-13). This will weaken it considerably. In vegetation, the antenna
should be positioned away from trees that are in the direction of the signal and erected as high as possible. Changing the location of the antenna
is also an option. Both horizontal and vertical orientations may be used
with the AS-4225 Parabolic Grid Antenna with UHF multi-channel
(MUX) radio equipment. Horizontal polarization is usually better for
passing through the trees, but if the signal is skimming over the tops of
the trees (probably unnoticeable) or over water, then the polarization
should be vertical (see fig. 3-14 on page 3-10).

GROUNDING TECHNIQUES
Poor grounding is probably the most important cause of a weak HF signal. Communication distances can easily be cut in half by improper
grounding of the antenna. More importantly, the hazards involved with
improper grounding coupled with high transmitter powers are bad burns,
electrical shocks, or even death (see fig. 3-15).
Grounding prevents electrical shock to operator and improves signal
strength, particularly in HF.

Radio Operator’s Handbook _____________________________ 3-11

Figure 3-15. Shock Hazards of Ungrounded Equipment.

Ground Stake
The ground stake provided with the antenna should be driven deeply into
the soil, making certain all connections are tight and clean. Soil moisture
and salinity around the ground stake are very important for good grounding. If a dry or a damp location is available, choose the damp spot. If
everything is bone dry, a couple of gallons of water poured around the
stake may help. Adding a pound or two of salt from the mess tent to the
soil around the stake before soaking it may help even more.
If a regulation ground stake is not available, there are many field-expedient means for grounding. The primary concern is to provide an electrical
path from the equipment case, using braided copper or heavy gauge
wire, to a buried metallic object that is in good contact with the ground.
All cable connections and grounds should be free of grease, paint, or
rust. Cables should be as short as possible.
Some useful grounds are—

Ground Radials
A ground radial system (i.e., counterpoise) is necessary to reduce the
amount of power lost in the earth (see fig. 3-16). This is particularly
important for HF whips, inverted As, and other vertical antennas. The
radial system design is usually a compromise between performance,
portability, and time to install the system. Ground radials help to establish a known reference point of electrical ground. Without them, electrical ground may be some distance beneath the Earth’s surface. Known
electrical ground is important not only for formation of the wavefront off
the antenna, but it also affects launch angles from antennas.

Radials are attached metal-to-metal to a central point (a metal plate is
often convenient). The radio frequency (RF) ground is attached to the
central plate (Figure 3-17).
Wire diameter is not critical; select a diameter small enough to be lightweight and transportable, but large enough to prevent breakage. The
largest number of radials to transport should be consistent with weight
and bulkiness limitations. It is not necessary to make them greater than
one-quarter wavelength at the lowest operating frequency.

Antennas
This chapter will discuss high frequency and very high frequency antennas. Antenna designs that work for HF sometimes work for VHF and
vice versa. The main difference is size; HF antennas are considerably
larger than VHF antennas. Ultrahigh frequency antennas are generally
limited to whips. When determining the best antenna to employ with a
circuit, consult MCRP 6-22D for more detailed information on antenna
propagation characteristics, as well as construction considerations and
procedures.
HIGH FREQUENCY ANTENNAS
Vertical Whip
A vertical whip antenna (i.e., whip) will most likely be used with an HF
radio. The whip is particularly good for ground wave communications in
many directions at one time, at distances of 20 to 30 kilometers. Unfortunately, while it is radiating in all directions at the same time, it is also
picking up interference from all directions. It is useless if using sky wave
over a distance of 100 kilometers, because of the high radiation angles
required. (NOTE: Launch angles off vertically polarized whip antennas
are maximum below 45°.) A vertical whip’s performance by sky wave,
however, improves with increased path distances.
A vehicle-mounted whip, tied down fairly close to the vehicle, may be
efficiently employed in short- and intermediate-distance HF sky wave
communications. A whip, tied back only a little, may be useful in longdistance HF sky wave applications.
Sloping Wire
If an HF circuit is only a single point-to-point ground link or a ground
wave net with all other terminals being located in the same direction, a

4-2 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
sloping wire may be used, if available. The radiating length of the AT984 “Fishreel” antenna (a 45-foot long, wire antenna which can be used
with the AN/PRC-104) can be varied by either connecting or disconnecting the alligator clips. (Antenna length is measured from the radio equipment.) See Table 4-1 to determine how long an antenna should be cut to
form an assigned frequency.

The far end of the antenna should be connected to a rope with a weight,
such as a stone or brick or other nonconducting material tied to the end.
The weighted end should be thrown over a tree so that the antenna forms
a 30° to 45° angle to the ground. Angles higher than 45° should be used
for ground wave, and lower angles for sky wave. The high end should be
opposite the direction of the intended receiver (see fig. 4-1).

Figure 4-2. AS-2259.

AS-2259 Near-Vertical Incidence
Another HF antenna is the AS-2259 (see fig. 4-2). Although not suitable
for frequencies under 3.5 MHz, this antenna can be used for both ground
wave and sky wave. The AS-2259 will often enable an operator to communicate in a skip zone when a whip antenna will not. In addition, it can
sometimes be used effectively to communicate by sky wave over a hill
or mountain obstacle that would otherwise block a ground wave signal.
More detailed information regarding HF NVIS antennas can be found in
MCRP 6-22D.
Horizontal Half -Wave Dipole (Doublet)
The horizontal half-wave dipole (also known as the doublet) is frequently used for short to medium HF sky wave paths (up to about 1,500
kilometers). It is usually installed at one-quarter wavelength of the operating frequency above ground (see fig. 4-3 on page 4-4). The major
drawback of this antenna is the unusually long length required (up to 71

4-4 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C

Figure 4-3. Doublet Antenna.

meters [233 feet] at 2 MHz). NOTE: A 2 percent or greater error in
length means less efficiency and a loss of radiated power.
Inverted L
Inverted L antennas are useful for NVIS propagation (see fig. 4-4).
Because of their construction, they also yield better ground wave radiation than whip antennas. Inverted L antennas can be effectively
employed with a wider range of frequencies than can horizontal halfwave dipole antennas.
Antenna Enhancements
Several pieces of equipment which improve the capabilities of standard
Marine Corps communications equipment are available from commercial sources. These items are not stocked in the Marine Corps supply
system. They must be purchased directly from commercial sources.

Whip loading coil (WLC)—used with the WTA for the AN/MRC138. This device makes the antenna more efficient at lower frequencies.
Whip to wire adapter (WWA)—screws into the top one-inch-diameter section of the AT-1011, thus allowing the operator to use the oneinch-diameter section of the AT-1011 as the mast for field-expedient
antennas.

Whip-base adapter (WBA)—allows the whip antennas for Army HF
radios to be used with Marine Corps HF radios. The whip antennas
for Army HF radios are of a different size than the whip antennas for
Marine Corps HF radios.

For further information about commercial equipment which can improve
the capabilities of Marine Corps radios, contact the G-6/S-6 sections of
higher headquarters.
VERY HIGH FREQUENCY ANTENNAS
OE-254
This antenna is used with VHF-FM radios to increase the operating
range beyond that of a normal whip. The two elements hanging down
from the antenna form a ground-plane similar to the ground radials discussed in chapter 3. The effect is to act as an artificial ground and greatly
increase the signal range. The antenna radiates in all directions at the
same time. The OE-254’s elements allow it to tune to frequencies
between 30 and 88 MHz without manually adjusting either the groundplane or radiating elements’ length. Figure 4-5 illustrates the OE-254
antenna.
Vertical Whip
VHF whip antennas are usually limited in range from 15 to 20 miles. A
whip antenna is omnidirectional; therefore, it has the potential to produce a great deal of radio-wave interference with the radios in the area. It
is important when using a whip antenna or any antenna to keep maximum distance between antennas. Use of hills and other terrain features
to block off unwanted signals will improve desired signal strength.
When using whip antennas with backpack or hand-held equipment, body
position may increase the transmitted and received signal. This is
because the human body acts as an antenna. If experiencing communication problems, the operator should try facing in different directions to
improve the reception of the signal.

ANTENNA LENGTH
The length of an antenna must be considered in two ways. It has both a
physical and an electrical length, and the two are never the same. The
reduced velocity of the wave on the antenna and a capacitive effect
(known as end effect) make the antenna seem longer electrically than it
is physically. The contributing factors are the ratio of the diameter of the
antenna to its length and the capacitive effect of terminal equipment
(e.g., insulators, clamps, etc.) used to support the antenna.
To calculate the physical length of an antenna, use a correction of 0.95
for frequencies between 3.0 and 50.0 MHz. The following figures are for
a half-wave antenna.

4-8 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
Length (meters)

= 150 x 0.95/Frequency in MHz
= 142.5/Frequency in MHz

Length (feet)

= 492 x 0.95/Frequency in MHz
= 468/Frequency in MHz

The length of a long-wire antenna (one wavelength or longer) for harmonic operation is calculated by using the following formula:
Length (meters)
Length (feet)

= 150(N-0.05)/Frequency in MHz
= 492(N-0.05)/Frequency in MHz

N = number of half-wave lengths in the total length of the antenna.
For example, if the number of half-wavelengths is 3 and the frequency in
MHz is 7, then:
Length (meters)

= 150(N-0.05)/Frequency in MHz
= 150(3-.05)/7
= 150 x 2.95/7
= 442.50/7
= 63.2 meters

Chapter 5

Interference
Radio frequency interference is always present in a military environment. It may come from a single source or a combination of many
sources including natural or manmade frequency interference, poor
equipment condition, improper equipment usage, frequency interference, use of unauthorized frequencies, and frequency reuse.
NATURAL INTERFERENCE
Natural radio noise has two principal sources: thunderstorms (atmospheric noise) and stars (galactic noise). It is especially noticeable at
night when the lower frequencies propagate farther than in the daytime.
The only way to reduce this type of interference is to use a directional
antenna to prevent receiving the interference from all directions. However, this will not eliminate the noise coming from the direction of the
received signal. Use of a higher frequency will also help, although if a
sky wave circuit is used, care must be exercised not to pick the highest
frequency at which the signal will be refracted to Earth by the ionosphere (i.e., the critical frequency).
MANMADE INTERFERENCE
Most manmade interference comes from electrical sources such as
power generators, alarm systems, power lines, auto ignition, fluorescent
lighting, faulty electrical relay contacts, and electrified railroads. Manmade interference also includes enemy jammers (see chapter 7). The key
to combating this form of interference is to isolate communications
equipment from manmade interference. The interference from known
sources such as generators can be greatly reduced if an antenna is positioned so that an obstacle (e.g., a hill) is between it and the source. This
must be done so that the same obstacle will not block the intended radio
path. If the interference is not coming from the same direction as the
intended signal, then a directional antenna should be used.

5-2 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
POOR EQUIPMENT CONDITION AND IMPROPER USAGE
The condition of radio equipment and how it is being used may result in
interference. There are several steps that should be taken to lessen this
possibility. These include making certain that shielded cables are used
where required, ensuring connectors are properly connected to cables,
and making sure that antennas within a group are as far apart as possible.
All antenna leads (transmission lines), power lines, and telephone lines
should be as short as possible when they are on the ground and should
not cross. If lines do cross, they must cross at 90° angles to each other,
and they must be separated from each other by standoffs. Lines threaded
through the trees near an antenna serve as pipelines for interference to
and from antennas. Finally, ensure that all radio equipment is grounded.
FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE AND INTERMODULATION
Frequency interference is one of the easiest communications problems to
prevent, but it must be done by the CIS officer, CIS chief, and frequency
manager during the development of the CIS plan. This type of interference is caused primarily by two radio transmitters using the same frequency, but it can also happen when different frequencies are used. Most
of these problems can be eliminated by good frequency planning. However, if frequency interference does occur the following steps can be
taken to improve communications:
l

l

l

l

Identify the source of the interference. If it is a VHF or HF ground
wave transmission, it will probably be within the immediate area and
will only occur when the offending transmitter is keyed. The other
operator is probably transmitting on a different frequency and has no
way of knowing that he is interfering with anyone else’s ability to
transmit.
Get the interfering operator to lower their transmitter power as long
as it does not degrade their circuit.
Put as much distance as possible between the affected unit’s equipment. This may involve using a hill or other object to block the signal.
Change to a directional antenna.

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 5-3

l

l

Remember that the receiver of interference may also cause someone
else interference and, whenever possible, should lower his power and
use a directional antenna.
Report interference to the CIS officer or CIS chief.
USE OF UNAUTHORIZED FREQUENCIES

There is one final source of frequency interference: the use of unauthorized frequencies. This practice is illegal and has the potential to disrupt
a carefully engineered frequency plan, introduce interference to other
frequencies and circuits, and prevent other units from fulfilling their
mission. Radio operators should never use unauthorized frequencies.
FREQUENCY REUSE
There are not enough radio frequencies available for all radio operators
to have their own channel. When HF propagation conditions are favorable, Marines may discover that their radio frequency is being used by
foreign or United States military personnel in other countries. VHF FM
frequencies often have to be reused within the same operation by more
than one unit. The exercise frequency manager will try to make certain
that users of the same frequency are as far away as possible from each
other, but some units (United States Marine Corps and Army, in particular) will join at some stage in the operation. When this occurs, the first
common, higher headquarters should be informed to settle the problem.

Radio Operations Under
Unusual Conditions
OPERATIONS IN DESERT AREAS
Capabilities and Limitations
SCR is usually the primary means of communications in the desert. It
can be employed effectively in desert climate and terrain to provide the
highly mobile means of communications demanded by widely dispersed
forces. However, desert terrain provides poor electrical ground, and
counterpoises are needed to improve operation.
Techniques for Operations
For the best operation in the desert, radio antennas should be located on
the highest terrain available. Transmitters using whip antennas in the
desert will lose one-fifth to one-third of their normal range because of
the poor electrical grounding characteristics of desert terrain. For this
reason, it is important to use complete antenna systems such as horizontal dipoles and vertical antennas with adequate counterpoises.
Equipment Considerations
Some SCRs automatically switch on their second blower fan if their
internal temperature rises too high. Normally, this happens only in temperate climates when the radios are transmitting. This may disturb
Marines unaccustomed to radio operation in the desert environment.
Operation of the second fan, however, is quite normal. RF power amplifiers used in AM and SSB sets are liable to overheat severely and burn
out. They should be turned on only when necessary (signal reception is
not affected). Since the RF power amplifiers take approximately 90 seconds to reach the operating mode, the standing operating procedure
(SOP) of units using the equipment should allow for delays in replying.

6-2 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
Dust affects communications equipment such as SSB/AM RF power
amplifiers. Dust covers should be used whenever possible. Some
receiver-transmitter units have ventilating ports and channels that can
get clogged with dust. These must be checked regularly and kept clean to
prevent overheating.
Batteries. Wet cell batteries do not hold their charge efficiently in intense

heat. Electrolyte evaporates rapidly and should be checked weekly
(more often, if warranted). Add distilled water as needed. Extra containers of distilled water should be carried in the vehicle. Maintenance of
vehicle batteries, beyond adding water, must be done only by authorized
motor-transport personnel according to applicable Marine Corps Orders
and SOPs. Dry battery supplies must be increased, since hot weather
causes batteries to fail more rapidly.
Electrical Insulation. Wind-blown sand and grit will damage electrical

wire insulation over a period of time. All cables that are likely to be
damaged should be protected with tape before insulation becomes worn.
Sand will also find its way into parts of items such as “spaghetti cord”
plugs, either preventing electrical contact or making it impossible to join
the plugs. Carry a brush, such as an old toothbrush, and use it to clean
such items before they are joined.
Condensation. In deserts with relatively high dew levels and high

humidity, overnight condensation can occur wherever surfaces (such as
metals exposed to air) are cooler than the air temperature. This condensation can affect electrical plugs, jacks, and connectors. All connectors
likely to be affected by condensation should be taped to prevent moisture
from contaminating the contacts. Plugs should be dried before inserting
them into equipment jacks. Excessive moisture or dew should be dried
from antenna connectors to prevent arcing.
Static Electricity. Static electricity is prevalent in the desert. It is caused

by many factors, e.g., wind-blown dust particles. Extremely low humidity contributes to static discharges between charged particles. Poor
grounding conditions exacerbate the problem. Be sure to tape all sharp
edges (tips) of antennas to cut down on wind-caused static discharges
and the accompanying noise. If you are operating from a fixed position,

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 6-3
ensure that equipment is properly grounded. Since static-caused noise
diminishes with an increase in frequency, use the highest frequencies
that are available and authorized.
Maintenance Improvement
In desert areas, the maintenance of SCRs becomes more difficult
because of the large amounts of sand, dust, or dirt that enter the equipment. Radios equipped with servomechanisms are particularly affected.
To reduce maintenance downtime, keep the radios in dustproof containers as much as possible. It is also important to keep air vent filters clean
to allow cool air to circulate to prevent overheating. Preventive maintenance checks should be made frequently. Also, keep a close check on
lubricated parts of the equipment. If dust and dirt mix with the lubricants, moving parts may be damaged.
OPERATIONS IN JUNGLE AREAS
Capabilities and Limitations
SCR communications in jungle areas must be carefully planned because
the dense jungle growth significantly reduces the range of radio transmission. However, since SCR can be deployed in many configurations,
especially manpacked, it is a valuable communications asset. Mobility is
also an advantage of SCR. The capabilities and limitations of SCR must
be carefully considered when used by forces in a jungle environment.
Climate and density of jungle growth limits SCR communications in
jungle areas. The hot and humid climate increases the maintenance problems of keeping equipment operable. Thick jungle growth acts as a vertically polarized absorbing screen for RF energy that reduces transmission
range. Therefore, increased emphasis on maintenance and antenna siting
is necessary when operating in jungle areas.
Techniques for Operations
The main problem in establishing SCR communications in jungle areas
is the siting of the antenna.

6-4 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
Apply the following techniques to improve communications in the
jungle:
l

l

l

l

l

Antennas should be located in clearings on the edge farthest from the
distant station and as high as possible.
Antenna cables and connectors should be kept off the ground to
lessen the effects of moisture, fungus, and insects. This also applies to
all power and telephone cables.
Complete antenna systems, such as ground planes and dipoles, are
more effective than fractional wavelength whip antennas.
Vegetation must be cleared from antenna sites. If an antenna touches
any foliage, especially wet foliage, the signal will be grounded.
Vegetation, particularly when wet, acts like a vertically polarized
screen and absorbs much of a vertically polarized signal. Horizontally
polarized antennas are preferred to vertically polarized antennas.

Maintenance Improvement
Because of moisture and fungus, the maintenance of SCR in tropical climates is more difficult than in temperate climates. The high relative
humidity causes condensation to form on the equipment and encourages
the growth of fungus. Operators and maintenance personnel should
check the appropriate TMs for any special maintenance requirements.
Some techniques for improving maintenance in jungle areas are—
l

l

l

Keep the equipment as dry as possible and in lighted areas to retard
fungus growth.
Keep all air vents clear of obstructions so air can circulate to cool and
dry the equipment.
Keep connectors, cables, and bare metal parts as free of fungus
growth as possible. Use moisture fungusproofing paint (MFP) to protect equipment after repairs are made or when equipment is damaged
or scratched.

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 6-5
High Frequency Expedient Antennas
Dismounted patrols and units of company size and below can greatly
improve their ability to communicate in the jungle by using expedient
antennas. While moving, they are generally restricted to using the short
and long antennas which come with the radios. However, when they are
not moving, these expedient antennas will allow them to broadcast farther and receive more clearly.
Note: An antenna that is not “tuned” or “cut” to the operating frequency is not as effective as the whips that are supplied with the radio.
Circuits inside the radio “load” the whips properly so that they are
“tuned” to give maximum output. Whips are not as effective as a tuned
doublet or tuned ground-plane, but the doublet or ground-plane must be
tuned to the operating frequency.
OPERATIONS IN A COLD WEATHER ENVIRONMENT
Capabilities and Limitations
SCR equipment has certain capabilities and limitations that must be
carefully considered when operating in extremely cold areas. However,
in spite of significant limitations, SCR is the normal means of communications in such areas.
One of the most important capabilities of SCR in cold weather areas is
its versatility. Vehicular-mounted radios can be moved relatively easily
to almost any point where it is possible to install a command headquarters. Smaller, manpacked radios can be carried to any point accessible by
foot or aircraft.
A limitation on radio communications that radio operators must expect
in extremely cold areas is interference by ionospheric disturbances.
These disturbances, known as ionospheric storms, have a definite
degrading effect on sky wave propagation. Moreover, either the storms
or the auroral (e.g., Northern Lights) activity can cause complete failure
of radio communications. Some frequencies may be blocked out completely by static for extended periods of time during storm activity.

6-6 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
Fading, caused by changes in the density and height of the ionosphere,
can also occur and may last from minutes to weeks. The occurrence of
these disturbances is difficult to predict. When they occur, the use of
alternate frequencies and a greater reliance on FM or other means of
communications are required.
Techniques for Operations
Whenever possible, SCR for tactical operations in cold weather areas
should be installed in vehicles to reduce the problem of transportation
and shelter for operators. This will also help solve some of the grounding
and antenna installation problems caused by the climate.
Because of permafrost and deep snow, it is difficult to establish good
electrical grounding in extremely cold areas. The conductivity of frozen
ground is often too low to provide good ground wave propagation. To
improve ground wave operation, use a counterpoise to offset the degrading effects of poor electrical ground conductivity. Remember to install a
counterpoise high enough above the ground so that it will not be covered
by snow.
In general, antenna installation in arcticlike areas presents no serious difficulties. However, installing some antennas may take longer because of
adverse working conditions. A few tips for installing antennas in
extremely cold areas are—
l

l

l

Mast sections and antenna cables must be handled carefully since
they become brittle in very low temperatures.
Antenna cables should be constructed overhead to prevent damage
from heavy snow and frost, whenever possible. Nylon rope guys, if
available, should be used in preference to cotton or hemp because
nylon ropes do not readily absorb moisture and are less likely to
freeze and break.
Antennas should have extra guy wires, supports, and anchor stakes to
withstand heavy ice and wind loading.

Some Marine Corps radios that are adjusted to a particular frequency in
a relatively warm place may drift off frequency when exposed to

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 6-7
extreme cold. Low battery voltage can also cause frequency drift. When
possible, allow a radio to warm up several minutes before placing it into
operation. Since extreme cold tends to lower output voltage of a dry battery, try warming the battery with body heat before operating the radio
set. This minimizes frequency drift. Flakes or pellets of highly electrically charged snow are sometimes experienced in northern regions.
When these particles strike the antenna, the resulting electrical discharge
causes a high-pitched static roar that can blanket all frequencies. To
overcome this static, antenna elements can be covered with polystyrene
tape and shellac.
Maintenance Improvement
The maintenance of SCR equipment in extreme cold presents many difficulties. Radios must be protected from blowing snow, since snow will
freeze to dials and knobs and blow into the wiring to cause shorts and
grounds. Cords and cables must be handled carefully since they may lose
their flexibility in extreme cold. All radio equipment and power units
must be properly winterized. Check the appropriate technical manual
(TM) for winterization procedures. A few tips for maintenance in arctic
areas are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Power Units. As the temperature goes down, it becomes increasingly dif-

ficult to operate and maintain generators. They should be protected as
much as possible from the weather.
Batteries. The effect of cold weather on wet and dry cell batteries

depends upon the type and kind of battery, the load on the battery, the
particular use of the battery, and the degree of exposure to cold temperatures.
Shock Damage. Damage may occur to vehicular SCR by the jolting of

the vehicle. Most synthetic rubber shock mounts become stiff and brittle
in extreme cold and fail to cushion equipment. Check the shock mounts
frequently and change them, as required.
Winterization. Check the TMs for the SCR and power source to see if

there are special precautions for operation in extremely cold climates.

6-8 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
For example, normal lubricants may solidify and permit damage or malfunctions. They must be replaced with the recommended arctic lubricants.
Microphones. Moisture from your breath may freeze on the perforated

cover plate of your microphone. Use standard microphone covers to prevent this. If standard covers are not available, improvise a suitable cover
from rubber or cellophane membranes or from rayon or nylon cloth.
Breathing and Sweating. A SCR generates heat when it is operated.

When it is turned off, the air inside cools and contracts and draws cold
air into the set from the outside. This is called breathing. When a radio
breathes, and the still-hot parts come in contact with subzero air, the
glass, plastic, and ceramic parts of the set may cool too rapidly and
break.
When cold equipment is brought suddenly into contact with warm air,
moisture will condense on the equipment parts. This is called sweating.
Before cold equipment is brought into a heated area, it should be
wrapped in a blanket or parka to ensure that it will warm gradually to
reduce sweating. Equipment must be thoroughly dry before it is taken
back out into the cold air or the moisture will freeze.
Vehicular-Mounted Radios. These radios present special problems during

winter operations because of their continuous exposure to the elements.
Proper starting procedures must be observed. The radio’s power switch
must be off prior to starting the vehicle; this is a particularly critical
requirement when vehicles are slave started. If the radio is cold soaked
from prolonged shutdown, frost may have collected inside the radio and
could cause circuit arcing. Hence, time should be allowed for the vehicle
heater to warm the radio sufficiently that any frost collected within the
radio has a chance to thaw. This may take up to an hour. Once the radio
has been turned on, it should warm up for approximately 15 minutes
before transmitting or changing frequencies. This allows components to
stabilize. If a vehicle is operated at a low idle with radios, heater, and
lights on, the batteries may run down. Before increasing engine revolutions per minute to charge the batteries, radios should be turned off to
avoid an excessive power surge. A light coat of silicon compound on

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 6-9
antenna mast connections helps to keep them from freezing together and
becoming hard to dismantle.
OPERATIONS IN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS
Capabilities and Limitations
Operation of SCRs in mountainous areas has many of the same problems
as in northern or cold weather areas. Also, the mountainous terrain
makes the selection of transmission sites a critical task. In addition, the
terrain restrictions encountered frequently make radio relay stations necessary for good communications.
Maintenance Improvement
Because of terrain obstacles, SCR transmissions will frequently have to
be by line of sight. Also, the ground in mountainous areas is often a poor
electrical conductor. Thus, a complete antenna system, such as a dipole
or ground-plane antenna with a counterpoise, should be used. The maintenance procedures required in mountainous areas are very often the
same as maintenance in northern or cold weather areas. The varied or
seasonal temperature and climatic conditions in mountainous areas make
flexible maintenance planning a necessity.
OPERATIONS IN SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTS
Urbanized Terrain
SCR communications in urbanized terrain poses special problems. Some
problems are similar to those encountered in mountainous areas. There
are problems of obstacles blocking transmission paths. There is the problem of poor electrical conductivity because of pavement surfaces. There
is also the problem of commercial power-line interference. VHF radios
are not as effective in urbanized terrain as they are in some other areas.
The power output and operating frequencies of these VHF radios require
a line of sight between antennas. Line of sight at street level is not
always possible in built-up areas.

6-10 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
HF radios do not require or rely on line of sight as much as VHF radios
because operating frequencies are lower, and power output is greater.
The problem is that HF radios are not organic to small units. To overcome this, the VHF signals must be retransmitted.
Retransmission stations in aerial platforms can provide the most effective means if they are available. Organic retransmission is more likely to
be used. The antenna should be hidden or blended in with surroundings.
This will help prevent the enemy from using it as a landmark to “home
in” his artillery bombardment. Antennas can be concealed by water towers, existing civilian antennas, or steeples.
The following steps should also be taken within urbanized terrain:
l

l

l

Park radio-equipped vehicles inside buildings for cover and concealment.
Dismount radio equipment and install it inside buildings (in basement, if available).
Place generators against buildings or under sheds to decrease noise
and provide concealment (adequate ventilation must be provided to
prevent heat buildup and subsequent failure of generator).

Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment
One of the realities of fighting on the modern battlefield is the presence
of nuclear weapons. The explosion of a nuclear weapon causes a tremendous blast, followed by intense heat and strong radiation. The ionization
of the atmosphere by a nuclear explosion will have degrading effects on
communications because of static and the disruption of the ionosphere.
Another effect of a nuclear explosion that is an even greater danger to
radio communications is the electromagnetic pulse (EMP). EMP is a
strong pulse of electromagnetic radiation, many times stronger than the
static pulse generated by lightning. This pulse can enter the radio
through the antenna system, power connections, and signal input connections. In the equipment, the pulse can break down circuit components
such as transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits. It can melt capacitors,
inductors, and transformers. EMP can destroy a radio.

Defensive measures against EMP call for proper maintenance, particularly the shielding of equipment. When the equipment is not in use, all
antennas and cables should be removed to decrease the effect of EMP on
the equipment. Effective grounding is necessary to reduce effect of EMP.
EMP is a danger to SCR equipment, but contamination is a danger to
Marines. Contamination from any portion of the nuclear, biological, and
chemical (NBC) environment has adverse effects on both equipment and
personnel.

Electronic Warfare
Electronic warfare (EW) is the military action involving the use of electromagnetic energy (i.e., radio frequency waves) to attack personnel,
facilities, or equipment with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or
destroying enemy combat capability. EW includes electronic attack
(EA), electronic protection (EP), and electronic warfare support (ES).
EA includes actions taken to prevent or reduce the enemy’s effective use
of the electromagnetic spectrum and employment of weapons that use
electromagnetic or directed energy. EP represents actions taken to protect personnel, facilities, and equipment from any effects of friendly or
enemy employment of electronic warfare that degrade, neutralize, or
destroy friendly combat capability. ES involves actions taken by, or
under direct control of, an operational commander to search for, intercept, identify, and locate sources of intentional or unintentional radiated
electromagnetic energy for the purpose of immediate threat recognition.
Each radio operator must be aware of what the enemy will try to do. The
enemy is well equipped to conduct EW, and the different techniques the
enemy uses have specific purposes in the enemy’s EW effort.
ELECTRONIC ATTACK TECHNIQUES
Enemy forces employ a large number of radio direction finder (RDF)
sets and communications intelligence (COMINT) analysts to exploit
friendly use of the electromagnetic spectrum. The enemy’s goal is to
locate and destroy as many command and control, fire support, and intelligence sites as possible during the first critical phase of the battle. When
the enemy locates sites that the enemy cannot or does not want to
destroy, these sites become prime targets for imitative electronic deception (IED) or jamming. Imitative electronic deception is the enemy’s use
of a compatible radio and a language expert to enter a friendly radio net.
The enemy IED experts are very good at their jobs. If they are permitted
to enter into a net, they will create much confusion for friendly forces.

7-2 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
Jamming is an effective way to disrupt control of the battle. All it takes
is a transmitter, tuned to your frequency, with the same type of modulation and with enough power output to override the signal at your
receiver.
There are many types of jamming signals that may be used against a
radio operator. Some are very difficult to detect and some are impossible
to detect. For this reason, an operator must always be alert to the probability of jamming and react accordingly when the radio has been silent
for an inordinate amount of time. The radio operator should also be able
to quickly identify the various types of jamming signals. These
include—

Capture Effect and Jamming Techniques
An inherent characteristic in FM communications is that a given station
transmitting a signal will capture those receivers on the same frequency
and in range for the receiver to detect the signal. This is the basis for netted communications for VHF FM radios. This FM capture effect is undesirable when receivers in a net are “captured” by a transmitter not in that
net. This could be friendly interference or enemy interference. Friendly
interference is usually unintentional whereas enemy interference is usually intentional.

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 7-3
Obvious Jamming
Radio operators are mostly aware of obvious interference (e.g., jamming) by an enemy, such as stepped tones (e.g., bagpipes), randomkeyed Morse Code, pulses, and recorded sounds. The purpose of this
type of jamming is to block out reception of friendly transmitted signals
and to cause a nuisance to the receiving operator. An operator can usually detect when the enemy is using this type of jamming.
Subtle Jamming
This type of jamming is not obvious at all. With subtle jamming, no
sound is heard from the receiver. The radio does not receive incoming
friendly signals, yet everything seems normal to the operator.
Operator Actions
Radio operators must be able to determine whether or not their radios are
being jammed. This is not always easy. Threat jammers may employ
obvious or subtle jamming techniques. These techniques may consist of
powerful unmodulated or noise-modulated carrier signals transmitted to
the operator’s receiver. Unmodulated jamming signals are characterized
by a lack of noise. Noise-modulated jamming signals are characterized
by obvious interference noises. If radio operators suspect that their
radios are the targets of threat jamming, the following procedures will
help them to make this determination.
Meaconing, Intrusion, Jamming, and Interference Report
If the radio operator suspects jamming or enemy intrusion on the net,
then the radio operator should report it immediately to higher headquarters. Such information is vital for the protection and defense of radio
communications.
Field meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference (MIJI) reports
serve two purposes. First, initial MIJI reports facilitate battlefield evaluations of the enemy’s actions or intentions and provide data for tactical
countermeasures, as appropriate. Second, complete and accurate followup reports ensure MIJI incidents are documented and evaluated on a

7-4 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
national level, thus providing data for a continuing study of foreign electronic warfare capabilities and activities.
MIJI reports may be transmitted over nonsecure electronic means when
secure communications are not available; however, the textual content of
the MIJI report will be secured by an off-line (i.e., manual) system.
Reports will be prepared in the format outlined in the following paragraphs. Brevity numbers pertinent to specific line item information are
provided for some items. These brevity numbers must be encoded in the
numeral cipher or authentication system prior to transmission. The two
types of field MIJI reports are—
l

l

MIJI 1—an abbreviated initial report containing only those items of
information necessary to inform headquarters of the incident and
enable them to initiate evaluatory or retaliatory actions as appropriate.
MIJI 2—consists of 40 lines and is completed by higher headquarters.

The MIJI 1 Report. This report is forwarded through the chain of com-

mand to the combat operations center by the operator who is experiencing the MIJI incident. A separate report is submitted for each MIJI
incident. The MIJI report includes—
l

l

Item 1—type report. When being transmitted over nonsecure communications means, the numerals 022 are encrypted as Item 1 of the
MIJI 1 report. When being transmitted over secure communications
means, the term MIJI 1 is used as Item 1 of the MIJI 1 report.
Item 2—type MIJI incident. When being transmitted over nonsecure
communications means, the appropriate numeral preceding one of the
items below is encrypted as Item 2 of the MIJI 1 report. When being
transmitted over secure communications means, the appropriate term
below is used as Item 2 of the MIJI 1 report.

2 Intrusion
3 Jamming
4 Interference

4 Satellite
5 Electro-optics
Item 4—Frequency or channel affected. When being transmitted over
nonsecure communications means, the frequency or channel affected
by the MIJI incident is encrypted as Item 4 of the MIJI 1 report.
When being transmitted over secure communications means, the frequency or channel affected by the MIJI incident is Item 4 of the MIJI
1 report.
Item 5—victim designation and call sign of affected station operator.
The complete call sign of the affected station operator is Item 5 of the
MIJI 1 report over both secure and nonsecure communications
means.
Item 6—coordinates of the affected station. When being transmitted
over nonsecure communications means, the complete grid coordinates of the affected station are encrypted as Item 6 of the MIJI 1
report. When being transmitted over secure communications means,
the complete grid coordinates of the affected station are Item 6 of the
MIJI 1 report.

The MIJI 2 Report. This is a complete report containing all details of the

MIJI incident. Due to the number of items which require encryption
when the report is transmitted over a nonsecure circuit, it is recommended that the report be delivered by messenger whenever possible.
The higher headquarters’ operations officer, intelligence officer, or the
electronic warfare officer is responsible for ensuring that a complete
message report of the incident is submitted to the Joint Command and
Control Warfare Center (JC2WC) within 24 hours of the incident.

7-6 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
ELECTRONIC PROTECTION TECHNIQUES
Communications security (COMSEC) is an integral part of electronic
protection. COMSEC is the protection resulting from all measures
designed to deny unauthorized persons information of value that might
be derived from the possession and study of telecommunications or to
mislead unauthorized persons in their interpretation of the results of such
possession and study. COMSEC includes transmission, cryptographic,
emission, and physical security.
The goal of COMSEC is to protect friendly communications from
enemy exploitation while ensuring unimpeded use of the electromagnetic spectrum. The organization must be able to employ communications equipment effectively in the face of enemy efforts.
COMSEC requirements must be integrated into communications systems planning and must focus on providing secure communications
without impairing reliability or responsiveness. Modern communications equipment includes features such as an integrated encryption capability and frequency hopping capability, which contribute to
communications protection. However, the security of our communications depends on the proper operation of communications equipment and
adherence to proper procedures.
Transmission security
Transmission security (TRANSEC) is that component of COMSEC that
results from all measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and exploitation by means other than cryptoanalysis. A message
transmitted in the clear is the enemy’s greatest source of information.
After the enemy has intercepted your radio transmission, the enemy’s
language specialists will extract all possible intelligence from it. The
enemy hopes to learn essential elements of friendly information (EEFI).
Critical information that must be protected can be remembered by the
key words SELDOM UP.

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 7-7
Each letter indicates a class of information as follows:
l
l
l
l
l
l
l
l

Strength—number of personnel, size of unit.
Equipment—type, quantity, condition.
Logistics—procedure for resupply, depots.
Disposition—were, what positions, map coordinates.
Organization—how, what, chain of command, forces structure.
Movement and morale—where, how, when and good or bad.
Units—type, designation.
Personalities—who, where.

Using TRANSEC is absolutely essential for the radio operator. When the
radio must be used, keep transmission time to an absolute minimum (20
seconds absolute maximum: 15 seconds maximum preferred); preplan
your messages to avoid compromising any essential element of information. If you must send EEFI items, use brevity lists, if possible, and also
encrypt the message. These measures decrease your transmission, help
prevent RDF, and deny the enemy valuable information. Included under
transmission security are the authentication procedures that must be followed to protect against the enemy’s IED. Every radio operator must be
aware of the dangers of and guard against IED.
Strict radio discipline and adherence to authorized procedures are key to
ensuring TRANSEC over SCR networks. SINCGARS radios should be
operated in a frequency hopping mode to provide maximum protection
against enemy EW capabilities. Other TRANSEC measures include—
l

l

l

Well-trained operators thoroughly familiar with proper communications procedures and equipment operation. (This includes all Marines
who may operate SCR, not just CIS personnel.)
Avoidance of unauthorized transmission and testing and maximum
use of data networks to minimize transmission time and opportunity
for enemy direction finding.
Use of transmitter, antenna, and power combinations that produce
minimum wave propagation and emission intensity consistent with
reliable communications.

7-8 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C

Strict adherence to authorized frequencies.
Use of authentication systems to protect against imitative deception
on nonsecure nets.
Use of changing call signs and frequencies on nonsecure nets.
Prompt response to and reporting of enemy jamming. (Operators
should continue to operate on assigned frequencies in a secure mode,
unless otherwise directed by a competent authority, and should
attempt to work through the interference.)
Strict adherence to all emission control (EMCON) restrictions and
observance of radio silence.
Use of communications means that do not radiate in the electromagnetic spectrum such as messengers, visual and sound signaling, and
local wire loops.
Use of terrain masking to shield transmission systems from enemy
EW systems.
Remoting of transmitters and avoiding the clustering of antennas.

Cryptosecurity
Cryptosecurity deals with codes, key lists, and communications security
devices. This is the third line of defense for the radio operator. If the
radio operator uses a security device on the radio, the enemy will not get
anything for the language specialists to work on. However, do not get a
false sense of security. The need for emission control and transmission
security still exists—probably more so—because, if the enemy can’t get
information, the enemy might attempt to destroy or jam your station.
Also, it is very important for all radio operators to use only authorized
codes and to realize that using homemade codes is dangerous. Homemade codes offer no protection at all. Their use is not authorized and is a
serious violation of security.
This also includes trying to “talk around” a classified or sensitive piece
of information. The enemy intelligence personnel are not fools, and trying something like “talking around” critical information does more harm
than good. If critical information must be transmitted, it should be
encrypted or sent by secure means. In a situation when it is not possible
to send by a secure means or to encrypt a message that must be sent, the

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ 7-9
possibility of what friendly forces will lose against what the enemy
could gain must be weighed. Other factors, such as how fast the enemy
could react to the information and what delaying the message for
encryption could mean, must also be considered.
Emission Security
Emission security (TEMPEST) is the component of COMSEC
that results from all measures taken to deny unauthorized persons
information of value that might be derived from interception and analysis of compromising emanations from cryptosecurity equipment and
telecommunications systems. The operation of communications and
information systems may result in unintentional electromagnetic emissions. Although tactical equipment is designed to reduce the possibility
of such emissions, COTS equipment is not. Unintentional emissions are
extremely susceptible to interception and analysis and may disclose classified information. Commanders must follow applicable regulations providing guidance on control and suppression of such emissions.
Physical Security
Physical security is the COMSEC component that results from all physical measures necessary to safeguard classified equipment, material, and
documents from access or observation by unauthorized persons. The
access to classified cryptographic information must be tightly controlled.
When a commander or designated representative has determined that an
individual has a need to know and is eligible for access, then access to
classified cryptographic information will be formally authorized. The
authorization process must include an introduction to the unique nature
of cryptographic information, its unusual sensitivity, the special security
regulations governing its handling and protection, and the penalties prescribed for its disclosure. Reportable violations include—
l
l
l

Loss of material.
Unauthorized viewing.
Capture of individuals having access to COMSEC information.

7-10 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
Currently fielded COMSEC equipment is unclassified for external viewing when appropriate covers are in place and no keying material is visible. Consequently, the exposure of such equipment to casual viewing by
uncleared personnel, whether by accident or as the result of operational
necessity, does not constitute a reportable violation.
EP techniques are divided into two categories: preventive and remedial.
Preventive EP are those procedures that can be used to avoid enemy EA
attempts. Remedial EP apply to jamming only; there are no remedial
measures once a unit has been intercepted, detected, or deceived.
ELECTRONIC WARFARE SUPPORT TECHNIQUES
Interception
The enemy is focused on intercepting your radio signal. To do this, all
the enemy needs is a radio receiver that operates in the same mode and
on the same frequency you are using to transmit. The mere fact that you
are operating gives the enemy valuable information. It tells the enemy
that you are in the area. By the number of stations operating on the same
frequency, the enemy can estimate the size of the unit. If your net is
operating in the clear, the enemy’s language specialists can understand
exactly what is said for even more information. When analyzing the traffic pattern, the enemy can figure out which station is the net control station (NCS) and identify the headquarters. Usually, in U.S. forces, the
NCS is the radio used by the operations officer or section of the highest
headquarters operating in the net. By further traffic analysis, the enemy
can determine changes in the level of activity that could mean a movement or upcoming operation.
Radio Direction Finding
Interception is only one of the many dangers that the radio operator will
face. After knowing friendly forces are in the area, the enemy will try to
locate their position by using radio direction finding (RDF). A radio
direction finder consists of a radio receiver, a directional antenna, and
other specialized equipment. With RDF equipment, the approximate azimuth (i.e., bearing) to a transmitting radio can be determined. One

Radio Operator’s Handbook _____________________________ 7-11
azimuth gives a general indication of direction. The intersection of two
azimuths by different RDF stations is called a cut and gives a general
indication of distance. The intersection of three or more azimuths is
called a fix and gives a general location. The ideal fix is the exact intersection of three or more bearings. However, exact intersection is seldom
achieved.
Terrain, weather, variations in radio wave propagation characteristics,
the inherent RDF equipment, and operator inaccuracies, prevent an ideal
fix. The fix that is obtained is called an actual fix. Although the actual
fix may not be usable for immediate targeting purposes, it is more than
enough for intelligence analysts to develop targeting data. Airborne
direction finding is more accurate than ground-based direction finding
but normally requires further analysis for targeting.
RDF ability to intercept electronics equipment emissions and determine
a bearing depends on the power output of the targeting transmitter and its
antenna radiation patterns. Experience indicates RDF accuracy of 500meter (547-yard [yd]) circular error of probability (CEP) is considered a
very good RDF fix. Normally, 50 percent of the CEPs are approximately
1,500 meters (1,640 yds) when the direction finder is located within 20
to 25 kilometers (12.4 to 15.5 mi) of the forward line of own troops
(FLOT). Many threat forces will fire on a 1,500-meter (1,640-yd) CEP if
they have sufficient massed artillery, and further analysis of terrain and
radio intercept can reduce the target area or identify an important target.

Map Coordinates
Field coordinates are often expressed in universal transverse mercator
grid coordinates and usually consist of 6-digit numbers. The typical map
used by the radio operator is a 1 to 50,000 scale topographic map that
has grid lines drawn on it, which are 1,000 meters (1 kilometer or klick)
apart. (See fig. A-1.)

To locate grid coordinate 632018, locate vertical line 63 (632018) in the

63 and 64. Likewise, find horizontal line 01 (632018) and draw a

horizontal line 8/10 of the way (632018) between it and line 02. The two
drawn lines intersect at Lone Pine.
Similarly, the intersection of the Lone Pine Fork with the Main Road in
the figure would be represented as 638004, and the Old Mine would be
618012.
Although the use of the 6-digit number is generally sufficient for field
use, a more exact coordinate will identify the 100,000 meter square and
the grid zone designation to avoid confusion between different areas
with identical grid line numbers.
A more detailed explanation of the complete coordinate may be found
centered at the bottom of a 1 to 50,000 scale topographic map. The
order in which the grids are read can be remembered by using the
expression read-right-up.

Time Zones
The world is divided into 24 time zones, each one bearing a unique phonetic letter name (ROMEO, UNIFORM, etc.) or time zone number that
must be applied to local time to arrive at the world standard time which
is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This standard time is referred to
in the Marine Corps as ZULU time. (See fig. B-1.) The time zones are
roughly 15° apart in longitude.

1300 ZULU would equate to 0800 local. During the summer, however, if
a Marine is located in an area where daylight savings time is observed,
one hour must be subtracted from the time zone number; i.e., the PLUS 8
zone becomes the PLUS 7 zone for local time purposes.

Authentication
Authentication systems are provided to prevent unauthorized enemy stations from entering friendly radio nets to disrupt or confuse operations.
The only authentication systems authorized are those approved for use
by the National Security Agency. If a special or emergency requirement
arises, notify the CIS officer (G-6/S-6).
INSTRUCTIONS
There are two methods of authentication that are authorized for use:
challenge and reply authentication and transmission authentication. The
operational distinction is that challenge and reply requires two-way
communications, whereas transmission authentication does not.
Challenge and Reply Authentication
Challenge and reply authentication will be used whenever possible. The
called party will always make the first challenge. Besides validating the
authenticity of the calling station, this practice prevents an enemy operator from entering a net to obtain correct authentication responses for use
in another net. The party making the call may counterchallenge the
called party using a different challenge.
Note: In challenge and reply authentication, only the station responding is verified. Do not accept a challenge as an authentication.
When a caller desires authentication, he must invite a challenge by stating that he is prepared to authenticate.
Another challenge should be made if an incorrect reply is received, if a
standby is requested, or if an unusual delay occurs between challenge
and reply.

J-2 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
Users will occasionally misauthenticate because of such problems as
having the wrong system, misreading the table, etc. The challenging station should attempt to pinpoint the difficulty and then rechallenge.
Never give the challenge and reply in the same transmission (self
authentication).
Transmission Authentication
Transmission authentication is used to validate the authenticity of the
message when it is impossible or impractical to use challenge and reply
authentication (see table J-1).
For Instructional Purposes Only

WHEN TO AUTHENTICATE
Transmission should be authenticated—
l

l

l

l
l

l
l

l
l
l

When any station suspects imitative deception on any circuit; e.g.,
when contacting a station following one or more unsuccessful
attempts to contact that station.
When any station is challenged or requested to authenticate. This is
not to be interpreted as requiring stations to break an imposed silence
for the sole purpose of authenticating.
When directing radio silence, listening silence, or requiring a station
to break an imposed silence.
When transmitting contact and amplifying reports in plain language.
When transmitting operating instructions that affect the military situation; e.g., closing down a station or watch, changing frequency other
than normal scheduled changes, directing establishment of a special
communication guard, requesting artillery fire support, directing relocation of units, etc.
When transmitting a plain language cancellation.
When making initial radio contact or resuming contact after prolonged interruptions.
When transmitting to a station that is under radio listening silence.
When authorized to transmit a classified message in the clear.
When forced, because of no response by the called station to send a
message in the blind (transmission authentication).

Note: Authentication is not required when making initial contact after
a scheduled call sign and frequency change since only bona fide stations will know their assigned call sign and frequency for the time
period in use.
For detailed authentication instructions refer to the automated communications-electronics operations instructions.

International Morse Code
Dots and dashes are used in various distinctive combinations to represent the letters of the alphabet, the numerals from 0 to 9, and the prosigns (see fig K-1). The dots and dashes of the Morse Code are produced
by keying a transmitter and causing it to transmit short and long signals.
The dash is 3 times the length of the dot. The dots and dashes used for a
letter are spaced from each other by a period of time equal in length to
one dot. Letters are spaced from each other by a period of time equal to
three dots. Words are spaced by a period of time equal to seven dots.

Appendix L

Frequency Prediction Means
Radio signals propagate from a transmitter to a receiver in different ways
depending on the selected frequency of the radio. The two available
resources for Marines to predict the best frequency to propagate over a
given path are to use the Joint Spectrum Center (JSC) or the Marine
Corps’ system planning, engineering, and evaluation device (SPEED).
See figure L-1 on page L-2.
JSC is a Department of Defense agency that is responsible for supplying
the electromagnetic analysis to the uniformed services. Located in
Annapolis, Maryland, JSC can perform a variety of propagation predictions on all ranges of frequencies. Once a quarter, JSC publishes a list of
HF frequency predictions for selected paths that the Marine Corps has
requested. A compilation of frequency predictions are held in the G-6
offices of the major subordinate commands within the Marine Corps.
The second method is SPEED. SPEED is computer software that allows
communications system planners to do rapid analysis of radio signal
propagation. The SPEED comes with electronic maps of the Earth which
allow true line of sight data for the planners, as well as HF propagation
prediction. SPEED is available down to the battalion level.

Position and Navigation Systems
Global positioning system (GPS) and position location reporting system
(PLRS) are new systems that radio operators may be required to operate.
GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
Global positioning system is a space-based navigation system designed
to provide 24-hour continuous worldwide, all-weather precise position,
and time measurement. The GPS consists of a space segment (satellite),
control segment (monitors stations on Earth), and user segment (GPS
receivers). The system operates by satellites sending out two signals on
nonchanging frequencies. The GPS receiver receives the signals transmitted by the satellites and computes the users position. GPS (by being
an all-weather, jam-resistant, continuous system) gives users highly
accurate navigation; worldwide, three-dimensional position or location
velocity; and time information. As a passive, receive-only system, GPS
can be employed at the individual level in such nondescript terrain as
jungles, mountain ranges, or deserts. (See fig. M-1 on page M-2.)
POSITION LOCATION REPORTING SYSTEM
PLRS is a system of UHF radios, signal and message processors, and
user input and output devices configured as master stations and basic
units that provide the user of the system with position navigation information and limited digital communications. PLRS works by the individual units in the network time sharing a single frequency band. As the
master station records the arrival time of the signal bursts from each user
unit at given locations, the range between sender and receiver can be
computed. If units are beyond line of sight for the master station, then
PLRS will automatically enable any user unit to serve as an automatic
relay. The full PLRS performance can be provided over a 47- by 47kilometer operating area. This operating area can be extended to a 300by 300-kilometer area through the use of airborne relays provided by
PLRS-equipped aircraft.

ENHANCED POSITION REPORTING SYSTEM
Enhanced position location reporting system (EPLRS) shares many
characteristics with PLRS, but provides a significant increase in data
communications capability over PLRS. Various data rates supporting a
variety of broadcast and point-to-point modes are currently available.
EPLRS will provide a dedicated data communications capability
between regiment and battalion tactical data networks (TDNs) within the
ground combat element, when fielded in FY-00. This network will also
be extended to lower echelons throughout the MAGTF. EPLRS can also
serve as a source for automated friendly position location information
and navigation information in a hybrid community with PLRS, though
data throughput is reduced.

Field Repair and Expedients
Section I. Antenna Repair
Antennas are sometimes broken or damaged, causing either a communications failure or poor communications. If a spare is available, replace
the damaged antenna. When there is no spare, you may have to construct
an emergency antenna. The following paragraphs are suggestions on
repairing antennas and antenna supports and on constructing and adjusting emergency antennas.
REPAIR TECHNIQUES
Whip Antennas
When a whip antenna is broken into two sections, the portion of the
antenna that is broken off can be connected to the portion attached to the
base by joining the sections as shown in figure O-1 on page O-2. Use the
method illustrated in figure O-1A, when both parts of the broken whip
are available and usable. Use the method shown in figure O-1B when the
portion of the whip that was broken off is lost, or when the whip is badly
damaged. To restore the antenna to its original length, add a piece of
wire that is nearly the same length as the missing part of the whip. Then,
lash the pole support securely to both sections of the antenna. Clean the
two antenna sections thoroughly to ensure good contact before connecting them to the pole support. If possible, solder the connections.
Wire Antennas
Emergency repair of a wire antenna may involve the repair or replacement of the wire used as the antenna or transmission line; or, the repair
or replacement of the assembly used to support the antenna.

Figure O-1. Emergency Repair of Broken Whip.

When one or more wires of an antenna are broken, the antenna can be
repaired by reconnecting the broken wires. To do this, lower the antenna
to the ground, clean the ends of the wires, and twist the wires together.
Whenever possible, solder the connection.
If the antenna is damaged beyond repair, construct a new one. Make sure
that the lengths of the wires of the substitute antenna are the same length
as the original.
Antenna supports may also require repair or replacement. A substitute
item may be used in place of a damaged support and, if properly insulated, can be of any material of adequate strength. If the radiating element is not properly insulated, field antennas may be shorted to ground
and rendered ineffective. Many commonly found items can be used as
field expedient insulators. The best of these items are plastic or glass, to
include plastic spoons, buttons, bottle necks, and plastic bags. Less
effective than plastic or glass but better than no insulators at all are wood
and rope, or both, in that order. The radiating element—the actual
antenna wire—should touch only the antenna terminal and be physically

separated from all other objects, other than the supporting insulator. Figure O-2 shows various emergency insulators.
Guys
Lines used to stabilize the supports for an antenna are called guys. These
lines are usually made of wire, manila rope, or nylon rope. If a rope
breaks, it may be repaired by tying the two broken ends together. If the
rope is too short after the tie is made, it can be lengthened by adding
another piece of dry wood or cloth. If a guy wire breaks, it can be

replaced with another piece of wire. Figure O-3 shows a method of
repairing a guy line with a spoon.

Figure O-3. Repaired Guy Lines and Masts.

Masts
Some antennas are supported by masts. If a mast breaks, it can be
replaced with one of same length. If long poles are not available as
replacements, short poles may be overlapped and lashed together with
rope or wire to provide a pole of the required length. Figure O-3 shows a
method of making an emergency repair to masts.

Radio Operator’s Handbook _____________________________ O-5
TIPS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND ADJUSTMENT
Constructing the Antenna
The best kinds of wire for antennas are copper and aluminum. In an
emergency, however, use any type that is available.
The length of most antennas is critical. The emergency antenna should
be the same length as the antenna it replaces.
Antennas supported by trees can usually survive heavy wind storms if
the trunk of a tree or a strong branch is used as a support. To keep the
antenna taut and to prevent it from breaking or stretching as the trees
sway, attach a spring or old inner tube to one end of the antenna. Another
technique is to pass a rope through a pulley or eyehook, attach the rope
to the end of the antenna, and load the rope with a heavy weight to keep
the antenna tightly drawn.
Guys used to hold antenna supports are made of rope or wire. To ensure
that the guys made of wire will not affect the operation of the antenna,
cut the wire into several short lengths and connect the pieces with insulators.
Adjusting the Antenna
An improvised antenna may change the performance of a radio set. Use
the following methods to determine if the antenna is operating properly.
A distant station may be used to test the antenna. If the signal received
from this station is strong, the antenna is operating satisfactorily. If the
signal is weak, adjust the height and length of the antenna and the transmission line to receive the strongest signal at a given setting on the volume control of the receiver. This is the best method of tuning an antenna
when transmission is dangerous or forbidden.
In some radio sets, the transmitter is used to adjust the antenna. First, set
the controls of the transmitter in the proper position for normal operation; then, tune the system by adjusting the antenna height, the antenna

Appo.fm Page 6 Friday, June 25, 1999 11:17 AM

O-6 ______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
length, and the transmission line length to obtain the best transmission
output.
Impedance-matching a load to its source is an important consideration in
transmissions’ systems. If the load and source are mismatched, part of
the power is reflected back along the transmission line towards the
source. This reflection not only prevents maximum power transfer, but
can also be responsible for erroneous measurements of other parameters,
or even cause circuit damage in high-power applications.
The power reflected from the load interferes with the incident (i.e., forward) power, causing standing waves of voltages and current to exist
along the line. The ratio of standing-wave maxima to minima is directly
related to the impedance mismatch of the load; therefore the standingwave ratio (SWR) provides the means of determining impedance and
mismatch.
WARNING
SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH CAN RESULT FROM CONTACT
WITH THE RADIATING ANTENNA OF A MEDIUM- OR HIGH-POWER TRANSMITTER. TURN THE TRANSMITTER OFF WHILE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ANTENNA.

Radio Operator’s Handbook _____________________________ O-7
Section II. Field Expedient Antennas
SINCGARS VHF radios provide the primary means of communications
for Marine Corps forces around the world. The SINCGARS radio operates in both single-channel and frequency hopping modes. It is important
for CIS personnel to remember that when using the SINCGARS radio in
the frequency hopping mode, field expedient VHF antennas should not
be used. CIS personnel should only use the whip antenna or the OE-254
antenna when operating in the frequency hopping mode.
HIGH FREQUENCY, FIELD EXPEDIENT
OMNIDIRECTIONAL ANTENNAS
Vertical antennas are omnidirectional; i.e., they transmit and receive
equally well in all directions. Most manpack portable radios use a
vertical whip antenna. A vertical antenna can be improvised by using a
metal pipe or rod of the correct length, held erect by means of guys. The
lower end of the antenna should be insulated from the ground by placing
it on insulating material. A vertical antenna may also be a wire, supported by a tree or a wooden pole (see fig. O-4). For short, vertical

antennas, the pole may be used without guys (if properly supported at
the base). If the length of the vertical mast is not long enough to support
the wire upright, it may be necessary to modify the connection at the top
of the antenna.
End-Fed Half-Wave Antenna
An emergency, end-fed half-wave antenna can be constructed from
available materials such as field wire, rope, and wooden insulators. The
electrical length of this antenna is measured from the antenna terminal
on the radio set to the far end of the antenna (see fig. O-5). Construct the
antenna longer than necessary, then shorten it, as required, until best
results are obtained. The ground terminal of the radio set should be connected to a good Earth ground for this antenna to function efficiently.

Figure O-6. Half-Wave Doublet Antenna.

Doublet antennas are directional broadside to their length, which makes
the vertical doublet antenna essentially omnidirectional. This is because
the radiation pattern is doughnut shaped. The horizontal doublet antenna
is bidirectional.
The length of a half-wave antenna may be computed by using the formula in Chapter 4. Cut the wires as closely as possible to the correct
length because the length of the antenna wires is important.
A transmission line is used for conducting electrical energy from one
point to another, and it is used to transfer the output of a transmitter to an
antenna. Although it is possible to connect an antenna directly to a transmitter, the antenna generally is located some distance away. In a vehicular installation, for example, the antenna is mounted outside, and the
transmitter is inside the vehicle. A transmission line, therefore, is necessary as a connecting link.
Center-fed half-wave FM antennas can be supported entirely by pieces
of wood. A horizontal antenna of this type is shown in figure O-7A; a
vertical antenna in figure O-7B on page O-10. These antennas can be
rotated to any position to obtain the best performance. If the antenna is
erected vertically, the transmission line should be brought out horizontally from the antenna for a distance equal to at least one-half of the
antenna’s length before it is dropped down to the radio set.

directional antennas. These antennas consist of a single wire, preferably
two or more wavelengths long, supported on poles at a height of 3 to 7
meters (10 to 20 feet) above the ground. The antennas will, however,
operate satisfactorily as low as 1 meter (approximately 3 feet) above the
ground. The far end of the wire is connected to ground through a noninductive resistor of 500 to 600 ohms. Use a resistor rated at least one-half
the wattage output of the transmitter to ensure the resistor is not burned
out by the output power of the transmitter. A reasonably good ground,
such as a number of ground rods or a counterpoise, should be used at
both ends of the antenna. The radiation pattern is directional. The antennas are used primarily for either transmitting or receiving high frequency
signals.

The Vee antenna is another field expedient, directional antenna. It consists of two wires forming a Vee with the open area of the Vee pointing
toward the desired direction of transmission or reception (see fig. O-12).
To make construction easier, the legs may slope downward from the
apex of the Vee (this is called a sloping Vee antenna [see fig. O-13 on
page O-14]).
The angle between the legs varies with the length of the legs in order to
achieve maximum performance.
When the antenna is used with more than one frequency or wavelength,
use an apex angle that is midway between the extreme angles determined by the chart.
To make the antenna radiate in only one direction, add noninductive terminating resistors from the end of each leg (not at the apex) to ground.

Radio Operator’s Checklist
Before you operate any radio set, get the appropriate equipment technical manual (TM) and carefully study the operating instructions. Refer to
the panel diagrams, connections diagrams, and the paragraphs covering
the description of components during the preliminary starting procedure.
Make sure that the proper cables are connected to the proper panel connectors, and that the controls are correctly set. Even the most experienced operators should check their preliminary procedures against the
TM references from time to time to insure accuracy and avoid damaging
the equipment. Use the operational checklist and the equipment performance checklist to determine what to do to remedy any problems
encountered during starting procedures and operation.
STEPS IN OPERATING RADIO SETS
Radio sets issued to a unit vary in type according to the communications
requirements of the unit. For example, some sets may be completely
contained in one assembly, while others may consist of separate components that must be properly connected to assemble a complete radio set.
The following steps are generally required in operating a radio set.
Check the Set for Completeness
Make sure that all the necessary components and accessories are on hand
and ready for use. Refer to the equipment basic issue items list in the
TM. Never operate the transmitter without the antenna attached.
Inspect the Condition of the Knobs, Dials, Switches, and
Controls
Look for knobs, dials, switches, and controls that are loose on their
shafts, bind when being operated, won’t operate, or are damaged in any
other way. Make corrections where possible or report the faulty

P-2 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
condition to the CIS officer or CIS chief. Make sure that all knobs and
exterior parts are on the set. Immediately report any that are missing.
Check the Condition of Plugs, Receptacles, and Connectors
Do not attempt to connect the set for operation until you are sure that the
plugs and connectors are clean and in good condition, and the receptacles to which they must be connected are also clean and in good condition.
Check the Connections Diagrams
The connections diagrams in the equipment TM show the type and number of cables required to interconnect the components of the radio set for
each type of operation. The radio set may be damaged if cables are connected to the wrong receptacles.
If the connectors don’t match, it is possible to physically damage the
pins or sleeves of the connector.
If a cable is connected to a receptacle into which it fits but does not
belong, it may cause serious electrical damage to the equipment and, in
some cases, injury to the operator.
Make Sure of Dial, Switch, and Control Settings
Some radio sets can be seriously damaged if the switches, dials, and controls are not set to the required initial settings before applying power or
making the initial timing adjustments. Before applying power, check the
equipment TM to be sure you performed all preliminary starting procedures. Be sure radios installed in vehicles are turned off before starting
the vehicle’s engine to avoid damage to radio equipment.
Follow the Starting Procedure
The equipment TM covers, in detail, the proper procedure for starting
the radio set. If there is a specific sequence for starting the set, it is
described in the manual. Perform the operations in the proper sequence.

Radio Operator’s Handbook ______________________________ P-3
Apply Power
After the proper connections are made, and all switches are properly set,
power may be applied to the set.
Allow the Set to Warm Up
Radio sets usually require a warm-up period when first applying power
in order to stabilize the equipment. In some cases, it is possible to damage a set by attempting to operate a set without allowing a warm-up
period. Most sets are protected against such damage, but it is foolish to
risk damage to a radio set by trying to put it on the air before it is ready.
Tune to the Desired Frequency (Channel)
Tune the transmitter to the frequency of the desired channel according to
the procedures in the equipment TM. Use the methods that are given in
the TM to check for correct tuning.
Check the Set for Normal Operation
While the set is in operation, check the indicators frequently to be sure
that the set is operating correctly. If anything unusual occurs during
operation, investigate it immediately. When necessary, turn off the
power to the set and refer to the operational checklist and the equipment
performance checklist in the equipment manual. If the corrections given
in the operational checklist and the equipment performance checklist
will not correct the trouble, report the condition to the unit electronics
maintenance shop. Make sure that the condition of the set and the action
taken are properly recorded on the maintenance records.
Use the Proper Procedure to Turn Off the Set
After operation (or if the set is being turned off because of improper
operation) make sure that the controls, switches, and dials are properly
set (this may not be required on some radios). Proceed to shut down the
components of the set in the sequence specified in the equipment manual. Simple radios may require nothing more than turning the power

P-4 _______________________________________________ MCRP 6-22C
switch to its OFF position, but more complex sets may require elaborate
shutdown procedures.
Operating Hints
Use a handset or headset, rather than a loudspeaker, if the incoming signal is weak. Make sure that the microphone or handset is in good condition. Speak directly into the microphone; speak slowly and distinctly.
Make sure that the vehicle’s battery voltage (if radio set is vehicularmounted) is within the correct range. Keep the engine running to charge
the battery. Move the set or the vehicle, if necessary, to improve reception.
Lack of communications or poor communications may be caused by—
