PREFACE

W

elcome to the world of amateur radio! We (the term “we” applies not
only to myself, but to all the pioneering hams who helped to make
amateur radio available to everyone) prepared this book with two major
objectives in mind. First, we want to introduce you to the exciting world
of amateur radio, one of the most interesting and challenging hobbies
available today. Once you’re hooked, our second objective is help
prepare you for the FCC Technician Class license examinations,
including both theory and Morse code. There is also another important
objective: enticing the many dedicated electronics and computer
experimenters, technicians, engineers, and serious CB enthusiasts
throughout the country to join the ranks of amateur radio operators.
In no other hobby can one find such a diversity of individual and
group endeavors involving scientific study and experimentation. The
fields of amateur radio range from basic electronics, voice and data communications on a local and world-wide basis, and space and satellite
communications to public service (especially during emergencies) and
close camaraderie or friendships that last a lifetime. Truly, amateur
radio is one of the largest fraternities in the world, open to persons of all
ages and nationalities. The No-Code Technician Class license—yes, at
last an amateur radio license with no Morse code examination—makes
it easy for you to become a ham operator in a minimum of time. Then to
earn hf Morse code and single-sideband voice privileges in selected hf
bands, you need only to pass a 5 words-per-minute Morse code test.
We’ll show you how to study for and pass both the Technician written
examination and the Morse code test.
This book is designed for either self-study or group use in Technician
Class code and theory classes. The only additional material needed is a
source of Morse code practice signals (cassettes or CDs) and a telegraph
key/code oscillator for generating Morse code signals. Also, excellent PC

and other home computer educational programs for both Morse code and
theory instruction are available.
Chapters 1 and 2 provide an introduction to amateur radio, the FCC
Part 97 Rules and Regulations for amateur radio, and how to prepare for
and take the Technician Class license code and theory examinations.
Chapters 3 through 10 form the basis for a “mini-course” in electronics
technology, with emphasis on radio communications. Chapter 11 provides specific and technical information on amateur radio operating
procedures, rf radiation safety requirements, and advanced amateur
radio communications systems involving single sideband, frequency
modulation, repeaters, digital and packet communications, and space
and satellite communications. The appendices contain the FCC Technician question pool, as well as answers for each question. Sounds
easy, doesn’t it? All it takes on your part is a concentrated study effort
to prepare for and pass the FCC license examinations.
We suggest that you review this book, chapter by chapter, before
starting a detailed study of the course material. This will give you an
overall perspective on amateur radio and help you develop a study
schedule. Finally, review the question pool in Appendix A. One
proven study technique is to write each FCC question on a 3-inch reference card, and your answer on the back. Check your answer against
the correct answer given in the appendix. The writing of the questions
and digging out the correct answers is part of the learning process. As
you write each question on the card, you also help to write the question
in your memory. To complete this process, review the set of cards until
you learn the correct answers to all questions for each required license
class examination. Remember, passing the Morse code examination
requires a code speed proficiency of at least five words per minute.
Build up this code speed before the end of your studies. With these factors in mind, you can develop a realistic schedule for preparing for the
FCC Technician code and theory examinations.
One final recommendation: contact the local amateur radio club or
a neighborhood ham and make arrangements for a volunteer examiner
(VE) to administer the FCC Technician Class license examinations.
Finding a ham in the neighborhood is easy—just check with the local
radio club or the volunteer examiner before taking the examinations.
Good luck!

INTRODUCTION

D

o you want to learn all about amateur radio? How to prepare for
the FCC license examinations, all about radio communications
and electronics principles, how personal computers can be used to
enhance the learning, as well as the operation, of amateur radio
comunications, how to assemble and operate an amateur radio “ham”
station? This is one of the most comprehensive books for the beginner
in amateur radio. It combines theory and practice in a clear and easyto-understand manner. The many illustrations and photographs make
learning all about amateur radio easy and exciting. The book contains
complete information on how to study for the Technician Class license
examinations and includes all of the FCC test questions and answers.
A variety of construction projects, transmitters, receivers, and other
electronic equipment are examined to give the beginner practical
experience in designing and building amateur radio projects. The book
also provides parts and source information for radio components,
equipment, and antennas, all typical of current-day technology. This
book is unique in that technical information concerning vacuum tubes
and associated circuits are covered. Why are these obsolete devices
covered in a modern book? Many excellent vacuum-tube amateur
receivers, transmitters, and transceivers are to be found at ham
swapfests and conventions. Also, many kilowatt final power amplifiers for amateur hf service are marketed by amateur suppliers today.
Anyone interested in amateur radio—student, electronics or CB
enthusiast, personal computer buff, doctor, lawyer, or engineer—will
want to explore this worldwide hobby. This book offers you the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of amateur radio.

Introduction to Amateur Radio

H

ave you ever listened to an AM or FM radio receiver and wondered
how radio waves travel through space? Have you gazed at a television set and asked how pictures generated on the other side of the
earth can be transmitted to your TV receiver? Have you operated a citizens band radio and wanted to extend your range of communications
worldwide? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may be
on the road to amateur radio, an exciting and rewarding hobby extending into almost every phase of electronics. Just pass the required Federal Communications Commission (FCC) exams given by authorized
amateur radio operators in your neighborhood and you’re ready to
become an amateur operator (or “ham”) yourself.

Who Can Become a Ham Radio Operator?
Anyone, regardless of age, is eligible to become a ham radio operator
in the United States. Persons from less than 10 years to over 80 years
of age have become hams.
Many disabled individuals have entered the ranks of amateur
radio. Operators can apply for special testing provisions if they have
physical disabilities. Learning materials are available on video or
audio tape or in books to assist in the learning processes. After becoming an amateur radio operator, the ham has many radio equipment

options. Many modern amateur radios (receivers, transmitters, etc.) provide voice outputs and can be controlled by computers using voice commands. Organizations such as the Courage HANDIHAM System (see
Chap. 2) provide a wide variety of services to aid those with disabilities.
Aliens, except representatives of foreign governments, are encouraged to apply for a U.S. ham license if they plan to be in the country
for an extended period of time. We’ll tell you how to prepare and
apply for your ham license in Chap. 2.

New Avenues into Amateur Radio
The FCC No-Code Technician License will allow you to enter the ranks
of amateur radio and get on the air with a minimum of effort. Yes, that’s
right—you can skip the Morse code tests and pass a written test for the
new No-Code Tech class license. This license allows you to operate on
all amateur bands above 50 megahertz (MHz), including the popular
6-meter and 2-meter bands with exciting local repeater and packet
radio operation, 440 MHz for amateur television, satellite and longrange “radio link” operation, and advanced microwave systems.
In case the megahertz and meter terms confuse you, just remember
that they refer to the bands of frequency for amateur operation. You probably already know that the AM broadcast band covers 540 to 1650 kilohertz (kHz) and the FM broadcast band covers 88 to 108 MHz. However,
we’ll explain the meaning of these and other terms later. The important
thing is that you can talk to other hams, using single sideband (SSB), frequency modulation (FM), or packet radio modes of operation. Then later,
if you want to get on some of the amateur radio high-frequency bands (i.e.,
below 50 MHz) for direct long-distance voice or Morse code contacts, you
can pass an easy five words per minute (WPM) Morse code test to qualify
for the Technician Class license. Finally, you can earn even more amateur
operating privileges by passing General and Extra Class license tests.
Remember, you can take any of these tests from qualified hams in your
area at a time convenient to you and the ham volunteer examiner.

About Amateur Radio
We live in a world of fantastic technological developments that affect
almost every phase of our daily lives. Space exploration, high-speed

INTRODUCTION TO AMATEUR RADIO

jet aircraft, and advanced developments in medicine, digital computers, and worldwide electronic communications are but a few of these
achievements. Amateur radio offers a challenging entry into exploring
much of the technology involved in many of these fields. Amateur
radio operators have made many significant contributions to radio
communications and electronics technology. In fact, many scientists,
engineers, and even astronauts pursue amateur radio as a rewarding
hobby. Many of NASA’s space shuttle craft flights include Shuttle
Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX) contacts with amateur radio
operators.
There are many fascinating aspects to amateur radio—talking to
fellow hams, participating in emergency communications during disasters, studying electronics technology, or building ham gear and
antennas using state-of-the-art electronic components. Many hams use
amateur radio as a steppingstone to a rewarding career in electronics.
But wait—this marvelous technology is only about 100 years old.
Before we get into the details of amateur radio and how to pass the
FCC exam for an amateur radio license, let’s look into the fascinating
history of amateur radio.

A History of Amateur Radio
A history of amateur radio would not be complete without acknowledging some of the early discoveries in the field of electricity and
magnetism. From the dawn of history, man has been fascinated by the
effects of electricity and magnetism produced by nature such as lightning, static electricity, and magnets.

Early pioneers
One of the first major scientific breakthroughs was made by Michael
Faraday, an English physicist and the son of a blacksmith, in the
early nineteenth century. Although he made many discoveries in
several scientific fields, Faraday’s major achievement was the discovery of electromagnetic induction and the formulation of the laws
of induction. Today we know this as the process where electrons
move in a conductor when the conductor is moved through a magnetic field. This discovery led to the development of the electric generator and motor.

4 CHAPTER ONE
In 1873 James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist-astronomer,
mathematically proved the existence of electromagnetic (or radio)
waves traveling at the speed of light. Now the stage was set to prove
the existence of radio waves in the laboratory.
About 15 years after Maxwell’s investigation (and 5 years after his
death), Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, demonstrated that radio
waves could be generated and transmitted over short distances of up to
about 60 feet (or about 20 meters). With his crude laboratory apparatus, Hertz was able to measure the wavelength of the waves he generated and show that these waves could be reflected, refracted, and
polarized just as light waves are. Working in the 150-MHz-and-above
radio spectrum, he designed and built spark-gap transmitters, resonator circuits for receiving radio waves, and directional antennas. As
you will see later, 1 MHz is the expression of radio frequency for 1 million Hertz, or 1 million cycles per second. This frequency of 150 MHz
is just above the amateur 2-meter band at 144–148 MHz.
In the early 1890s Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian inventor, began to
experiment with radio waves using equipment similar to that developed by Hertz and other scientists of the era (Fig. 1.1). Marconi made
many improvements and inventions that resulted in extending the
range of radio transmissions. He conceived the concept of a vertical
radiating antenna, and the Marconi (or vertical) antenna is one of his
major accomplishments.
Marconi’s first crude equipment was capable of a range of about
one-half mile (about 800 meters). In 1896 he moved from Bologna,
Italy, to England, where he made substantial improvements that
increased the operating range of his equipment to about 4 miles (about
6.5 kilometers). By 1898, he succeeded in transmitting “wireless” signals across the English Channel. A major milestone was reached in
1901 when Marconi and his English associates transmitted radio
waves across the Atlantic Ocean from Poldu, England, to Halifax,
Newfoundland. Thus born, long-range radio communications would
have an impact upon the lives of all people regardless of nationality or
position in life.
The first major use of the new wireless telegraph sets was to provide for maritime communications. By 1905, spark-gap transmitters
and coherer detector receivers were installed on many of the merchant
ships and naval vessels on the high seas. For the first time, instant

communications between remote ships and land-based communications centers were feasible. All of this was accomplished without the
use of vacuum tubes or transistors— they would be invented later
to provide for amplification of the weak radio signals intercepted by
the antennas.

Beginning of amateur radio
The introduction of commercial wireless telegraph equipment after the
turn of the century aroused the imagination and interest of people
around the world. Some experimenters were content to build simple
crystal detector receivers and monitor the raspy code signals transmitted from fixed or rotary spark transmitters at marine or government
communications stations. Other experimenters, particularly the restless and aggressive youngsters, assembled spark-gap transmitters, as
well as crystal detector receivers, and began sending “dots and dashes”
between home separated by a few miles (Fig. 1.2). The range of these
early “amateur” stations was increased by continual improvements in
equipment and higher power output. Amateur wireless organizations

favorable conditions, the transmitter could be heard for distances up to about 30 miles.

Ch01_Laster 9/25/01 12:47 PM Page 7

INTRODUCTION TO AMATEUR RADIO

were formed across the country, beginning with the Junior Wireless
Club of New York in January 1909. Amateur radio had come of age!
During radio’s infancy, no government rules or regulations were in
effect to govern the use of wireless operations. Wavelengths, or operating frequencies, in the vicinity of 300 to 1000 meters were selected by
the users on the basis of available equipment. The inevitable conflict
between commercial and amateur users abruptly surfaced when interference from amateur transmissions threatened the reliability of commercial radio communications. The U.S. Navy, which was quickly
developing radio communications facilities, addressed some of the
administrative problems and began issuing “certificates of skill in
radio communications” in lieu of licenses. By late 1910, the Navy had
issued some 500 of these certificates, many to amateur operators.
By this time, the number of individuals interested in or participating in amateur radio had grown to an estimated 10,000 or more. Amateur transmitters with power outputs of several kilowatts could be
heard up to 400 miles (about 650 kilometers) away. However, most
amateurs could not afford such luxury and had to be content with
ranges of about 5 miles (8 kilometers), with occasional contacts up to
100 miles (160 kilometers). Many wireless equipment stores had
appeared by this time, selling crystal detectors, spark-gaps, induction
coils, and tuners—the basic ingredients of wireless stations.

First licenses for amateur radio operators
Beginning in 1902, the U.S. Congress recognized the need for regulating the use of wireless operation. However, it was not until 1910 that
the first bill (the Act of June 24, 1910) was passed. This bill required
the mandatory use of wireless equipment on certain ocean steamers
and did not apply to amateur radio. Some bills were introduced in the
Congress that would have given all authority for radio communications to the government. If passed, any of these bills would have abolished amateur radio. Fortunately, these bills were defeated and
amateur experimentation increased at a rapid rate.
Finally in 1912, Congress passed an all-encompassing bill covering all phases of radio communications in the United States. Amateur operation was restricted to wavelengths below 200 meters and
maximum power levels of 1 kilowatt. The lawmakers believed that

7

Ch01_Laster 9/25/01 12:47 PM Page 8

8 CHAPTER ONE
wavelengths below 200 meters were useless and that this restriction
would eventually eliminate the troublesome amateur radio society.
This action by the government proved to be a gold mine for the
amateur operators. Refinements in electronics technology and the
introduction of the new deForest vacuum tube allowed the amateurs
to build short-wave equipment capable of spanning distances of hundreds of miles with low power. Radio clubs were established in all
parts of the country. Amateurs began to send personal messages for
other individuals to distant cities and remote locations. Emergency
communications during periods of disasters were now emerging as a
major contribution by the amateurs.
By 1914, the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) was formed to
promote the concept of national relaying of amateur traffic across the
country. Through the dynamic leadership of Hiram Percy Maxim, the
ARRL grew to become the largest amateur radio organization in the
United States. By late 1914, efficient relay networks were organized
over most of the eastern United States and many stations were dedicated to handling traffic as a public service. By 1915, the ARRL introduced QST, a radio amateur journal devoted solely to the pursuits of
amateur radio. Today, the ARRL membership includes over 120,000 in
North America and some 12,000 foreign and unlicensed associate
members. You’ll want to consider joining the ARRL to support amateur radio and to receive the monthly QST. This magazine features
construction articles, technical information, news concerning amateurs and amateur meetings, etc. For more information, you can contact the American Radio Relay League at ARRL, 225 Main Street,
Newington, CT 06111-1494; telephone: (860) 594-0200; or on the
World Wide Web at: http://www.arrl.org/.

The death knell for amateur radio
All amateur radio operations were suspended when the United States
entered World War I in 1917. The government order suspending all
forms of amateur radio required that the aerial wires be lowered to the
ground and all radio apparatus for transmitting and receiving be disconnected from the antennas and rendered inoperative.
The U.S. military forces were faced, at the beginning of the war,
with virtually no radio operators, instructors, or technical specialists. The ARRL assisted the government in locating volunteers

Ch01_Laster 9/25/01 12:47 PM Page 9

INTRODUCTION TO AMATEUR RADIO

among the amateur ranks to meet immediate needs in the military.
In addition, some of the equipment from the more elaborate amateur
stations was released to the government for use by the military. Altogether, an estimated 3500 to 4000 amateur radio operators served in
the U.S. Armed Forces, contributing their knowledge and expertise
in radio communications to the war effort. When the armistice ending World War I was signed in November 1918, the amateurs were
impatient to resume operation. However, the U.S. Congress was considering legislation that would eliminate all forms of amateur radio
activity. This legislation would have granted control of all forms of
radio communications to the Navy Department. Fortunately, amateur operators, led by ARRL President Maxim, descended upon Congress and mounted sufficient opposition to defeat the proposed bill.
Control and regulation of radio communications was left to the
Commerce Department. The wartime ban on amateur radio activity
was finally lifted on November 1, 1919.
After 212 years of silence, the amateurs were finally permitted to
resume operation. There was a rush to obtain licenses and get back on
the air. Some of the amateurs dusted off their old spark-gap transmitters and crystal-detector receivers for immediate operation. Others
began to adapt to the new vacuum tubes for both transmitter and
receiver use. Radio parts houses sprang up in all major urban areas and
mail-order firms began to advertise regularly in the few available radio
publications, such as QST.

The golden age of amateur radio
Beginning in the late 1920s, amateur radio experienced phenomenal
growth in the numbers of operators and in radio communications technology. This growth continued until the United States entered World
War II in 1941 and the amateurs were forced to cease operation for the
duration of the war. During this period, the number of amateurs had
increased from almost 17,000 in 1929 to over 54,000 in 1941.
The typical ham of the 1930s was a young high-school or tradeschool graduate with little or no extra money with which to buy radio
equipment. Fortunately, the coming of age of the commercial radio
broadcasting field brought a bonanza of radio parts that could be
adapted to amateur radio uses. Used AM broadcast receiving tubes
were readily available at little cost for the amateur-built receivers and

9

Ch01_Laster 9/25/01 12:47 PM Page 10

10 CHAPTER ONE
transmitters. The typical amateur transmitter consisted of a single-tube
oscillator circuit. The power output of this simple rig varied from about
1 to 2 watts, depending on the power supply and the type of tube. A
two-tube receiver with a regenerative detector and audio amplifier was
used by most amateurs in the early 1930s. Dry-cell batteries or a junkbox “battery-eliminator” power supply normally served to power the
transmitter and receiver. Today, you can build and use simple shortwave receivers and QRP (low-power) transmitters for contacts with
other hams over distances of thousands of miles (Fig. 1.3). These easyto-build radios are described in Chaps. 8 and 9.
This period of amateur radio saw many important technological
advances. In fact, most of the techniques and tools used by the modern
amateur were developed and tested during this time period. These
developments included the superheterodyne receiver, single-sideband

INTRODUCTION TO AMATEUR RADIO

modulation, frequency modulation, high-gain beam antennas, and vhf
communications techniques. Amateur experimentation ranged from
improving simple transmitters and receivers to pioneering developments in radio astronomy.
The old raspy sounds of the spark-gap transmitters had been
replaced by the clear, crisp signals of continuous-wave (cw) transmitters and voice-modulated rigs. Amateur radio had become a permanent part of the American way of life.

Amateur Radio—A Scientific Hobby
Amateur radio today is a highly specialized hobby involving almost all
phases of electronics. There are about 500,000 ham radio operators in
the United States. Worldwide, there are some 700,000 amateurs, and
almost all countries authorize some form of amateur radio. Hams come
from all walks of life: for example, students, salesmen, plumbers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, seamen, and the handicapped.
The FCC, which administers and regulates all radio activity in the
United States, defines the Amateur Radio Service as one of self-training, intercommunication, and technical investigation carried on by
amateur radio operators.
The great appeal of amateur radio is centered on the incredible ability to communicate person-to-person worldwide and a fascination
with the marvels of electronics. Hams constantly keep abreast of technical advances in electronics, and in some cases it is the ham who pioneers the development of some phase of radio or electronics.
Amateur radio activity today ranges from high-frequency (80 to
100 meters) communications [involving cw, single-sideband voice,
data (computer-to-computer and teletypewriter), and slow-scan television] to amateur communications satellites operating on frequencies from 28 MHz to 435 MHz and microwave frequencies (Figs. 1.4
and 1.5). Another space-age development is that of moon-bounce
communications using the moon as a passive reflector for communications signals in the 144-MHz to 2450-MHz frequency bands. A
recent development in the electronics field—digital microelectronics—is being adapted to amateur radio with increasing applications.
The integrated-circuit (IC) chips containing logic gates, flip-flops,
and even a complete “computer-on-a-chip” or digital processor, are

11

Ch01_Laster 9/25/01 12:47 PM Page 12

12 CHAPTER ONE
available to hams at bargain-basement
prices. A typical IC chip—containing up
to a hundred or more transistors, diodes,
and resistors and forming many digital
circuits—will cost the ham a mere $0.50
to several dollars each. Hams have
adapted these chips to digital circuits
ranging from electronic keyers to Morse
code translators. Many ham “shacks”
include a personal computer (PC) for
maintaining station log records, propagation analysis, packet radio, locations of
amateur satellites, and even automatic
tracking of the station antennas for satellite communications. By the way, don’t
be alarmed by the subjects mentioned
above—we’ll cover all of them in this
book.
Another exciting aspect of microelectronic circuits is the operational amplifier
(op-amp) and related types of “analog” IC
chips. The availability of the op-amp has

power transmitters. We will examine some
of these devices in subsequent chapters and show you how you can
build a complete ham station with a minimum of cost and effort.

Amateur Radio Public Service
One of the most important aspects of amateur radio is that of public
service. The FCC states that one justification for the Amateur Radio
Service is the recognition and enhancement of the value of the amateur service to the public as a voluntary noncommercial communi-

cations service, particularly with respect to providing emergency
communications.
One of the first disasters for which amateurs provided emergency
communications was the heavy sleet storm that hit western and northern New York State in December 1929. The storm tore down telephone
and power lines and isolated many cities in the area. Hams assisted
telephone and power companies and the railroads in establishing
emergency communications.
Since that time, hams have been instrumental in establishing emergency communications during natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, fires, storms, explosions, train wrecks, and plane crashes.
Although space does not permit a complete summary of these activities,
some of the major disasters during which hams provided emergency
communications were Hurricane Carla in Texas (September 1961), Hurricane Hugo in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico (September 1989), and
the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989).
In addition to major disasters, hams have continually been in the
forefront in providing communications in the event of personal

13

Ch01_Laster 9/25/01 12:47 PM Page 14

14 CHAPTER ONE
emergencies such as a lost child, an automobile accident, or participation in an eye transplant bank.
Hams are organized in almost all communities to provide communications service to the public. Each year, hams participate in Field Day
exercises during which they set up simulated emergency field communications centers powered by portable gasoline or diesel generators
(Fig. 1.6). In addition to Field Day, hams across the country practice
sending emergency traffic on Simulated Emergency Traffic (SET) Day.
The radio amateur’s contribution to the country during war has
been outstanding. In World War I, some 4000 hams served in the
Armed Forces. Again in World War II, more than 24,000 hams served
in the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps, contributing their skills and talent to the war effort. Countless numbers of
other hams were engaged in electronics research and manufacturing
activities supporting the war effort. During the Korean and Vietnam

INTRODUCTION TO AMATEUR RADIO

conflicts, amateurs relayed many messages from service personnel
overseas to their families and friends in the States. These traffic nets
handled personal messages via relay stations located mostly on the
West Coast. In many cases, the service personnel were able to talk
directly to their loved ones in the United States using telephone
patches established by the amateurs.
Another important area of public service by the amateur is in providing communications for expeditions to remote areas such as the
Arctic and Antarctic. In 1923, Con Mix, 1TS (early call signs did not
have a W, K, A, or N prefix) accompanied MacMillan to the Arctic
aboard the schooner Bowdoin. Hams in Canada and the United States
provided home contacts for the explorers. Since that time, amateurs
have assisted some 200 expeditions. At present, amateurs provide
much of the personal communications for the personnel at the Antarctic research stations.

The Path into Amateur Radio—The Technician
Class License
Prior to April 15, 2000, the beginner in amateur radio could select the
Novice Class, Technician (Tech-Plus) Class, or the No-Code Technician Class License. Today, the entry-level license is the Technician
Class, which requires only a 35-question written examination. The
operating privileges for the Technician cover all amateur bands above
50 MHz. This includes the 6-meter band (50–54 MHz), the 2-meter
band (144–148 MHz), and the 70-cm band (420–450 MHz). Additional
hf operating frequencies are available when the Technician Class amateur operator passes the 5-WPM Morse code test. Tables 1.1 and 1.2
present the key information on these Technician operating bands.
With this preliminary background, let’s get started on the basics of
amateur radio. We want you to learn the theory of ham radio as well as
a good proficiency in Morse code as soon as possible. In this way, you
can schedule and pass the Technician examination in a minimum of
time. Good luck and good contacts!

Technician Operating Bands, Privileges, and Normal Communications Capability

Communications Capability

6 meters

50–54 MHz: Morse code (cw), single sideband
voice (SSB), frequency modulation voice (SSB),
radio printer (RTTY), FM repeaters, radio control
(RC), experimental modes and signal beacons

This band features almost all modes of propagation as it
is situated between the hf and vhf frequency bands. During times of high sunspot activity, daytime contacts of
up to 3200 km (2000 miles) are possible via skywave
propagation. Routine contacts of up to 500 km (300
miles) are possible with high-power transmitters and
high-gain antennas. Sporadic E-layer propagation is a
favorite of 6-meter hams, providing short band openings
at distances of up to about 3000 km (1200 miles).

2 meters

144–148 MHz: Most of the above privileges plus:
amateur satellite operation, earth-moon-earth
(EME or “moon bounce”), packet (digital) radio

Most hams use the 2-meter band for local repeater operation. Most metropolitan areas will have literally dozens
of 2-meter repeaters. The higher frequencies permit
smaller antennas and inexpensive repeater equipment.
The 2-meter mobile for automobiles (and even airplanes
and boats) and hand-held (HT, or walkie-talkies) permit
new hams to get on the air with a minimum of equipment and small, inexpensive antennas. Some hams do
build elaborate 2-meter stations that can provide longrange contacts of up to about 2000 km (1200 miles) via
sporadic E-layer propagation and tropospheric ducting.
Finally, the “line of sight” propagation mode of 2-meter
frequency signals is used extensively in amateur ratio
satellite and earth-moon-earth (EME) operations.

70 centimeters

420–450 MHz: Most of the above privileges plus:
amateur television (ATV)

As with 2 meters, the 70-centimeter band is very popular
for amateur radio repeater, satellite, and EME operation.
The small size of 70-centimeter radios and antennas permits installation of 70-centimeter radios almost anywhere. More elaborate 70-centimeter stations can also
permit long-range contacts between “earth-bound” hams
over distance of up to about 2000 km (1200 miles). Propagation in these cases includes ionospheric modes and
meteor scatter.

35 centimeters

902–928 MHz: Most of above privileges plus:
digital communications and wideband ATV

The 35-centimeter and 23-centimeter bands represent
the amateur’s entry into the microwave frequencies. Here,
the assembly and construction of ham microwave equipment are much different than those in the lower frequency
bands. A short length of wire—say 2.5 to 7 cm (1 to 3
inches)—may act as an inductor or a filter, or even as an
antenna! Small and compact is the name of the game.
Also, propagation of microwave signals is very similar to
that of optical or light signals. Much amateur operation in
these bands is accomplished in the “line of sight” mode.
However, more elaborate amateur stations can accomplish
long-range contacts from 50 to 500 miles or more.

Amateur bands above the 902- to 928-MHz band extend up to 300 GHz. Much of this part of the radio frequency spectrum is still
undeveloped, with little equipment available for amateur use. Considerable research and development, some by amateur radio specialists, is being accomplished to develop new equipment and investigate propagation techniques in these higher frequency bands.

How to Prepare for the FCC
Technician Class Examination
The Entrance to the World of Amateur Radio Is Easy
The FCC has established the Technician license for the beginner in
amateur radio. Furthermore, the FCC authorizes local volunteer examiners to administer the examinations for the Technician Class license
and higher class licenses such as the General Class and Extra Class
licenses. As stated in Chap. 1, the Technician Class license provides
for all amateur radio operating privileges above 50 MHz. To qualify for
selected operating privileges in the amateur HF bands, you must pass
a 5 words per minute (WPM) Morse code test.
The Technician Class license examination has 35 questions, and
passing requires a minimum of 75 percent (or a total of 27) correct
answers. This written examination covers radio theory, FCC rules and
regulations, and operating procedures—all the knowledge you will
need to set up and operate your ham station. As a general rule, you can
master the requirements for the Technician Class license with two or
three months of dedicated study. Considerable less time (six to eight
weeks) will be sufficient if you are fortunate to enroll in local “Code and
Theory” classes handled by amateur radio clubs or civic organizations.
To prepare for the Technician examination, the beginner in amateur
radio can obtain any necessary help from a variety of sources. One of the
more successful approaches is to enroll in a Technician class sponsored
by a local ham club or other organizations, such as the YMCA or a
church group. These courses give you the advantage of studying with

your peers in an educational environment. Most of these courses will
run for about 7 to 10 weeks with one or two class periods per week. Each
period may last for about 2 to 4 hours. The final class period is usually
a test session whereby the volunteer examiner (VE) team is scheduled to
hold an open test session. Classes sponsored by the local ham club are
usually very inexpensive, sometimes only the cost of the course text and
a year’s club membership dues. If no local ham course is available, the
neighborhood ham (or “Elmer” as they are affectionately called) will be
pleased to help you prepare for your Technician exam.
Self-study is another approach for learning the material required for
the Technician examination. This book covers all of the material contained in the Technician examination—namely, FCC rules and regulations, electronics theory, ham receivers and transmitters, antennas and
propagation, and radio communications practices and operating procedures. Furthermore, this book contains the actual FCC question pool
from which the 35 Technician examination questions are taken. Yes,
you actually have access to the Technician question pool, and answers
to each question are available at the end of this book (see Appendix A).
Additional study guides for amateur radio examinations are available from various sources. For example, the amateur radio organizations listed below offer study texts, videotapes, and computer software
packages designed to make learning the required material more efficient (Fig. 2.1).

radio transmitters in the United States and aboard all U.S.-registered
ships and aircraft. Unlike many other countries, the U.S. does not
license the possession of radio receivers. The “bible” of radio laws that
governs all FCC activity contains some 40 parts. The Amateur Radio
Service is covered in Part 97, Rules and Regulations. A copy of Part 97
can be obtained from the ARRL, local ham radio and book stores, or the
FCC. Also, Part 97 can be downloaded from the Government Printing
Office at www.gpo.gov.
The structure of the FCC includes a headquarters located in Washington, DC, a license and call-sign processing facility in Gettysburg,
Pennsylvania, some 16 radio districts or field offices, and some 13 FCC
monitoring stations. For more information concerning any FCC radio

Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th Street SW, Washington, DC 20554 [telephone: (202) 418-0200, fax: (202) 418-2555].

The FCC Volunteer Examiner Program
The FCC has “deregulated” the amateur radio service in terms of amateur radio license examinations. In effect, the responsibility for administering all examinations for amateur radio licenses has been
transferred to the amateur radio community. The chances are good that
any local ham club will be affiliated with the ARRL and will be authorized by the ARRL to administer all amateur radio license examinations, including the Technician Class exam.
Examinations for the Technician and higher-class (General and
Extra) amateur radio licenses are administered by amateur radio VE
teams. Each VE team consist of a minimum of three qualified volunteer
examiners, certified by a volunteer examiner coordinator (VEC) authorized by the FCC. The ARRL and the W5YI Group are representative of
the VECs. Each VEC must maintain a question pool (available to the
public), prepare and administer license examinations, make public
announcements for examination schedules, and qualify VE personnel.
The VEC entity must be organized, at least partially, for the purpose
of furthering amateur radio, and agree not to accept any compensation
from any source for its services. However, in order to defray the
expense of preparing and administering tests, the VEC is authorized to
charge a maximum fee (on the order of $6) for each applicant.

FCC Amateur Radio Operating Classes
There are currently five classes of amateur radio licenses, which provide increasing privileges at each step forward. However, the recent
FCC changes to the amateur license structure call for the eventual
elimination of the Novice and Advanced Class Licenses. Current
licensed Novice and Advanced amateur operators may continue to
operate on the authorized amateur frequency bands or elect to upgrade
to higher-class licenses. No new FCC examinations for the Novice and
Advanced class licenses will be permitted. The Technician Class
license is now the entry level into amateur radio. As a Technician

HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FCC TECHNICIAN CLASS EXAMINATION

Class amateur operator, you will enjoy all amateur privileges above 50
MHz. No Morse code test is required for the Technician Class license.
However, you must pass a 35-question written examination (Element 2)
to receive this license. Technician Class privileges can be expanded to
selected portions of the HF bands by passing the Element 1, a 5-WPM
Morse code test.
The second step in amateur radio is the General Class license. This
license requires that you pass a second 35-question written exam (Element 3) and have credit for the 5-WPM Morse code test (Element 1). In
return, you will receive operating privileges for all or portions of all amateur bands. This includes the exciting hf bands between 3 and 30 MHz.
The top amateur license, the Amateur Extra Class, requires passing
a 50-question written exam (Element 4) on advanced topics. This “top
prize” in amateur radio gives you all the operating privileges in all
amateur bands. Keep this goal in mind as you progress through the
ranks of amateur radio.
A summary of the amateur radio license requirements and privileges is given in Table 2.1. Note that the Technician Class license permits the beginner to obtain valuable experience in virtually all types of
amateur radio communications.

The Amateur Radio Frequency Spectrum
The amateur radio frequency begins just above the AM broadcast band
(540–1650 kHz) at 1800 kHz and contains small “chunks” of bandwidth or bands of frequencies up to 300 GHz and beyond. At this time,
the amateur portion of the radio frequency spectrum is probably the
largest of any single user organization. However, as electronic techniques and development of communications equipment for the higher
frequency bands advance, commercial and government organizations
will find ways to use these bands.
One of the strengths of amateur radio that attracts so many people
is the abundance and diverse nature of the frequency spectrum allocated to amateur radio operators. Amateurs can build and/or experiment with a wide variety of antennas, radio receivers, radio
transmitters, computers, and other communications systems that operate from the 1800–2000 kHz band to the microwave frequency bands
(tens of thousands of megahertz near the optical frequencies of light).

Each amateur radio band exhibits a unique set of characteristics,
requiring special techniques for designing and building antennas,
transmission lines, transmitters, and receivers. Some amateur radio
bands permit reliable communications on a worldwide basis, while
others are limited primarily to “line-of-sight” propagation. Some
amateurs specialize in the HF bands (3–30 MHz) for long-range DX
contacts involving single sideband (SSB) voice, Morse code (CW)
communications, or amateur slow-scan television. Some of these
amateurs use low-power “QRP rigs” of only a few watts to work with
other amateurs over long distances. Many of these QRP rigs are easily built and tested. Other amateurs experiment with digital data
transmissions involving computer-to-computer operation and slowscan television systems in the VHF and UHF frequency bands. You
will probably want to investigate many of these exciting aspects of
ham radio.
Figure 2.2 shows the total amateur radio frequency spectrum,
including the Technician Class license operating privileges. Many of
the amateur bands are assigned on approximate octave intervals
throughout the spectrum. For example, the 40-meter band is approxi-

Ch02_Laster_136187-1

Page 25

mately twice the frequency of the 80-meter band. In many instances,
this octave relationship aids in the design and construction of multiband radio transmitters, receivers, and even antennas. Additional
information concerning the methods of modulation and propagation
characteristics is discussed in Chap. 3. For a more detailed and up-todate listing of amateur frequencies and operating privileges, refer to
the current edition of the ARRL Handbook for the Radio Amateur.

FCC Rules and Regulations
Part 97: Amateur Radio Service
Basic law comprising rules and regulations essential to the operation
of amateur radio stations is contained in the Rules and Regulations of
the FCC, Part 97: Amateur Radio Service. As stated earlier, a copy of
Part 97 may be obtained from the U.S. Printing Office or directly from
the FCC. You are encouraged to obtain a copy of this document.
We will review Part 97 in terms of the Technician Class license
examination and subsequent Technician station operation, and provide selected portions of Part 97. You should become completely
familiar with these rules and regulations prior to taking the written
examination. Virtually all the FCC rules presented here relate to questions that will appear on the Element 2 exam.
BASIS AND PURPOSE.

This section expresses the justification for the existence of the Amateur Radio Service. You may have wondered why the Amateur Radio
Service controls so much of the valuable radio frequency spectrum.
This justification is based on the following five functions of amateur
radio.
97.1 Basis and purpose. The rules and regulations in this part are
designed to provide an amateur radio service having a fundamental
purpose as expressed in the following principles:
(a) Recognition and enhancement of the value of the amateur radio
service to the public as a voluntary noncommercial service particularly with respect to providing emergency communications.

Hz. Power-line frequency in the United States is 60 Hz while those in countries such
as England and France are 50 Hz. You need to learn the frequency range definitions to
help you pass the FCC written examinations as well as their use during amateur operations. You will find that the frequencies of amateur bands can be expressed in kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz), or gigahertz (GHz), depending on the particular amateur
band.

HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FCC TECHNICIAN CLASS EXAMINATION

Part 97.3(c) defines the standard terms used to describe signal emission types from amateur radio transmitters. The signal types authorized for Technicians are given as follows:
1. CW. Sometimes referred to as “continuous wave,” CW is defined as
the International Morse Code telegraphy, usually transmitted from
a radio transmitter via an operator using a hand key or automatic
keying device, sometimes generated by a computer.
2. RTTY. RTTY or radioteletypewriter direct-printing telegraph emissions provide for transmission of mostly textual information. Older
mechanical teletypewriter equipment has a typewriter-like keyboard to generate messages composed primarily of alpha and
numeric characters along with generation of punctuation symbols
and end-of-line and line-feed control characters. RTTY electrical
signals, generated by the keyboards and connected to a printer to
print messages, consist of digital codes representing characters
such as letters or numbers. Only FCC specified codes (such as the
old 5-unit Baudot or the 7-unit ASCII codes) can be used for transmitting RTTY signals. The newer personal computers can be used
to generate and receive RTTY signals. We’ll cover more on this subject in Chap. 11.
3. Data. Data represents a broad class of telemetry, telecommand, or
computer communications emissions. Here’s where the Technician
operators can use their PCs for such exciting transmission modes as
Packet and AMTOR. In general, the amateur operator is restricted to
the use of FCC-approved digital codes.
4. Phone. Phone, or voice communications, allows the Technician
operator to talk to other hams via local or long-distance contacts.
The Technician with 5 WPM certification, for example, can use single-sideband voice on specified frequencies in the 10-meter band
and all voice modes on all amateur bands above 50 MHz.
5. Image. Image emission types include facsimile and television signals. Technician operators can experiment with these modes of
emission on all amateur bands above 50 MHz.
6. Spread spectrum. Spread-spectrum emissions involving “frequency hopping” over a wide band of frequencies are authorized on

for amateur operation.
AMATEUR STATION/OPERATOR LICENSE REGULATIONS

Part 97 contains the following FCC regulations concerning amateur
operator and station license requirements. You will find that the FCC
Amateur Radio License actually covers the operator privileges and the
station authorization—two separate licenses on one slip of paper! The
operator portion authorizes you to be the “control operator” of your
amateur station or another amateur’s station provided the station
owner gives you permission.
The combination FCC amateur license also authorizes you to have
your own amateur radio station.
Part 97.5

Station license required.

(a) The station apparatus must be under the physical control of a person named in an amateur station license grant on the ULS consolidated license database or a person authorized for alien reciprocal
operation by Part 97.107 of this part, before the station may transmit on any amateur service frequency from any place that is:
(1) Within 50 km of the Earth’s surface and at a place where the
amateur service is regulated by the FCC;
(2) Within 50 km of the Earth’s surface and aboard any vessel or
craft that is documented or registered in the United States; or
(3) More than 50 km above the Earth’s surface aboard any craft
that is documented or registered in the United States.
(b) The types of station license grants are:
(1) An operator/primary station license grant. One, but only one,
operator/primary station license grant may be held by any
one person. The primary station license is granted together
with the amateur operator license. Except for a representative
of a foreign government, any person who qualifies by examination is eligible to apply for an operator/primary station
license grant.
(2) A club station license grant. A club station license grant may
be held only by the person who is the license trustee desig-

nated by an officer of the club. The trustee must be a person
who holds an Amateur Extra, Advanced, General, Technician Plus, or Technician operator license grant. The club
must be composed of at least four persons and must have a
name, a document of organization, management, and a primary purpose devoted to amateur service activities consistent with this part.
A military recreation station license grant. A military recreation station grant may be held only by the person who is the
license custodian designated by the official in charge of the
United States military recreation premises where the station
is situated. The person must not be a representative of a foreign government. The person need not hold an amateur
license grant.
A RACES station grant license. A RACES station license
grant may be held only by the person who is the license custodian designated by the official responsible for the government agency served by that civil defense organization. The
custodian must be the civil defense official responsible for
coordination of all civil defense activities in the area concerned. The custodian must not be a representative of a foreign government. The custodian need not hold an amateur
operator license grant.

Part 97.7 Control operation required. When transmitting, each
amateur station must have a control operator. The control operator
must be a person:
(a) For whom the amateur operator/primary station license grant
appears on the ULS consolidated license database, or
(b) Who is authorized for alien reciprocal operation by Part 97.107 of
this part.

Part 97.9 Operator license.

Technician Plus Class license), General, Advanced, and Amateur
Extra. The person named in the operator license grant is authorized to be the control operator of an amateur station with the
privileges authorized to the operator class specified on the
license grant.
(b) The person named in an operator license grant of Novice, Technician, Technician Plus, General, or Advanced Class who has properly submitted to the administering VEs an FCC Form 605
document requesting examination for an operator license grant to
a higher class, and who holds a CSCE indicating that the person
has completed the necessary examinations within the previous
365 days, is authorized to exercise the rights and privileges of the
higher operator class until final disposition of the application or
until 365 days following the passing of the examination,
whichever comes first.

Part 97.13

Restrictions on station location.

(a) Before placing an amateur station on land of environmental
importance or that is significant in American history, architecture,
or culture, the licensee may be requested to take certain actions
prescribed by Para 1.1305-1.1319 of the Communications Act of
1934, as amended.
(b) A station within 1600 meters (1 mile) of an FCC monitoring facility must protect that facility from harmful interference.
(c) Before causing or allowing an amateur station to transmit from
any place where the operation of the station could cause human
exposure to RF electromagnetic field levels in excess of those
allowed under Part 1.1310 of this chapter, the licensee is required
to take certain actions:
(1) The licensee must perform the routine RF environmental
evaluation prescribed by Para 1.1307(b) of this chapter, if the
power of the licensee’s station exceeds the limits given in

STATION OPERATING STANDARDS.

This section of Part 97 covers amateur radio station operating standards.
You will need to master these standards to help you pass the FCC examinations and for effective operation of your amateur station.
Part 97.101 General standards.
(a) In all respects not specifically covered by FCC Rules each amateur
station must be operated in accordance with good engineering and
good amateur practice.
(b) Each station licensee and each control operator must cooperate in
selecting transmitting channels and in making the most effective
use of the amateur service frequencies. No frequency will be
assigned for the exclusive use of any station.
(c) At all times and on all frequencies, each control operator must
give priority to stations providing emergency communications,
except to stations transmitting communications for training drills
and tests in RACES.
(d) No amateur operator shall willfully or maliciously interfere with
or cause interference to any radio communication or signal.
Part 97.103 Station licensee responsibilities.
(a) The station licensee is responsible for the proper operation of the
station in accordance with FCC Rules. When the control operator

Ch02_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:47 PM

Page 41

HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FCC TECHNICIAN CLASS EXAMINATION

is a different amateur than the station licensee, both persons are
equally responsible for proper operation of the station.
(b) The station licensee must designate the station control operator.
The FCC will presume that the station licensee is also the control
operator, unless documentation to the contrary is in the station
records.
(c) The station licensee must make the station and the station records
available for inspection upon request by an FCC representative.
When deemed necessary by an EIC to assure compliance with the
FCC Rules, the station licensee must maintain a record of station
operation containing such items of information as the EIC may
require with Part 0.314(x) of the FCC Rules.
Part 97.105 Control operator duties.
(a) The control operator must ensure the immediate proper operation
of the station, regardless of the type of control.
(b) A station may only be operated in the manner and to the extent
permitted by the privileges authorized for the class of operator
license held by the control operator.
Part 97.109

Station control.

(a) Each amateur station must have at least one control point.
(b) When a station is being locally controlled, the control operator
must be at the control point. Any station may be locally controlled.
(c) When a station is being remotely controlled, the control operator
must be at the control point. Any station may be remotely controlled.
(d) When a station is being automatically controlled, the control operator need not be at the control point. Only stations specifically
designated elsewhere in this Part may be automatically controlled. Automatic control must cease upon notification by an EIC
that the station is transmitting improperly or causing harmful
interference to other stations. Automatic control must not be
resumed without prior approval of the FCC.

an incident of a teaching position during periods of time when an
amateur station is used by that teacher as a part of classroom
instruction at an educational institution.
(d) The control operator of a club station may accept compensation for
the periods of time when the station is transmitting telegraphy
practice or information bulletins, provided that the station transmits such telegraphy practice and bulletins for at least 40 hours per
week and schedules operations on at least six amateur service MF
and HF bands using reasonable measures to maximize coverage,
where the schedule of normal operating times and frequencies is
published at least 30 days in advance of the actual transmissions
and where the control operator does not accept any direct or indirect compensation for any other service as a control operator.
(e) No station shall transmit programs or signals emanating from any
type of radio station other than an amateur station, except propagation and weather forecast information intended for use by the
general public and originating from United States Government
stations and communications, including incidental music, originating on United States Government frequencies between a space
shuttle and its associated Earth stations. Prior approval for shuttle
retransmissions must be obtained from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. Such retransmissions must be for the
exclusive use of amateur operators. Propagation, weather forecasts, and shuttle retransmissions may not be conducted on a regular basis, but only occasionally, as an incident of normal amateur
radio communications.
(f)

No amateur station, except an auxiliary, repeater, or space station,
may automatically retransmit the radio signals of other amateur
stations.

Part 97.115 Third party communications.
(a) An amateur station may transmit messages for a third party to:
(1) Any station within the jurisdiction of the United States.
(2) Any station within the jurisdiction of a foreign government
whose administration has made arrangements with the

Ch02_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:47 PM

Page 45

HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FCC TECHNICIAN CLASS EXAMINATION

United States to allow amateur stations to be used for transmitting international communications on behalf of third parties. No station shall transmit messages for a third party to
any station within the jurisdiction of any foreign government
whose administration has not made such an arrangement.
This prohibition does not apply to a message for any third
party who is eligible to be a control operator of the station.
(b) The third party may participate in stating the message where:
(1) The control party is present at the control point and is continuously monitoring and supervising the third party’s participation.
(2) The third party is not a prior amateur service licensee whose
license was revoked; suspended for less than the balance of
the license term and the suspension is still in effect; suspended for the balance of the license term and relicensing
has not taken place; or surrendered for cancellation following notice of revocation, suspension, or monetary forfeiture
proceedings. The third party may not be the subject of a
cease and desist order which relates to amateur service operation and which is still in effect.
(c) At the end of an exchange of international third party communications, the station must also transmit in the station identification
procedure the call sign of the station with which a third party
message was exchanged.
Part 97.119

Station identification.

(a) Each amateur station, except a space station or telecommand station, must transmit its assigned call station on its transmitting
channel at the end of each communication, and at least every 10
minutes during a transmission, for the purpose of clearly making
the source of the transmission from the station known to those
receiving the transmissions. No station may transmit unidentified
communications or signals, or transmit as the station call sign,
any call sign not authorized to the station.
(b) The call sign must be transmitted with an emission authorized for
the transmitting channel in one of the following ways:

(4)

By a CW emission. When keyed by an automatic device used
only for identification, the speed must not exceed 20 words
per minute;
By a phone emission in the English language. Use of a standard phonetic alphabet as an aid for correct station identification is encouraged;
By a RTTY emission using a specified digital code when all
or part of the communications are transmitted by a RTTY or
data emission;
By an image emission conforming to the applicable transmission standards, either color or monochrome, of Part
73.682(a) of the FCC Rules, when all or part of the communications are transmitted in the same image emission.

(c) One or more indicators may be included with the call sign. Each
indicator must be separated from the call sign by the slant mark (/)
or by any suitable word that denotes the slant mark. If an indicator is self-assigned, it must be included before, after, or both before
and after the call sign. No self-assigned indicator may conflict
with any other indicator specified by the FCC Rules or with any
prefix assigned to another country.
(d) When transmitting in conjunction with an event of special significance, a station may substitute for its assigned call sign a special
event call sign as shown for that station for that period of time on
the common database, maintained and disseminated by the special event call sign database coordinators. Additionally, the station must transmit its assigned call sign at least once per hour
during such transmissions.
(e) When the operator license class held by the control operator
exceeds that of the station licensee, an indicator consisting of the
call sign assigned to the control operator’s station must be
included after the call sign.
(f)

When the control operator is exercising the rights and privileges
authorized by Part 97.9(b), an indicator must be included after the
call sign as follows:
(1) For a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice to Technician Class: KT

Advanced Class: AA; or
For a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice, Technician, General, or Advanced Class
operator to Amateur Extra Class: AE

Part 97.121 Restricted operation.
(a) If the operation of an amateur station causes general interference
to the reception of transmissions from stations operating in the
domestic broadcast service where receivers of good engineering
design, including adequate selectivity characteristics, are used to
receive such transmissions, and this fact is made known to the
amateur station licensee, the amateur station shall not be operated
during the hours from 8 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., local time, and on
Sunday for the additional period from 10:30 a.m. until 1 p.m.,
local time, upon the frequency or frequencies used when the
interference is created.
(b) In general, such steps as may be necessary to minimize interference to stations operating in other services may be required after
investigation by the FCC.
Part 97.203 Beacon station.
(a) Any amateur station licensed to a holder of a Technician, Technician Plus, General, Advanced, or Amateur Extra operator license
may be a beacon. A holder of a Technician, Technician Plus, General, Advanced, or Amateur Extra Class operator license may be
the control operator of a beacon, subject to the privileges of the
class of operator license held.
(b) A beacon must not currently transmit on more than one channel
in the same amateur service frequency band, from the same station location.
(c) The transmitting power of a beacon must not exceed 100 W.

or on the 33 cm and shorter wavelength bands.
(g) A beacon may transmit one-way communications.
Part 97.205 Repeater stations.
(a) Any amateur station licensed to a holder of a Technician, General,
Advanced, or Amateur Extra Class operator license may be a
repeater. A holder of a Technician, General, Advanced, or Amateur
Extra Class operator license may be the control operator of a repeater,
subject to the privileges of the class of operator license held.
(b) A repeater may receive and transmit only on the 10 m and shorter
wavelength frequency bands except the 28.0–29.5 MHz, 50.0–51.0
MHz, 144.0–144.5 MHz, 145.5–146.0 MHz, 222.00–222.15 MHz,
431.0–433.0 MHz, and 435.0–438.0 MHz segments.
(c) When the transmissions of a repeater cause harmful interference to
another repeater, the two station licensees are equally and fully
responsible for resolving the interference unless the operation of one
station is recommended by a frequency coordinator and the operation of the other is not. In that case, the licensee of the noncoordinated repeater has primary responsibility to resolve the interference.
(d) A repeater may be automatically controlled.
(e) Ancillary functions of a repeater that are available to users on the
input channel are not considered remotely controlled functions of
that station. Limiting the use of a repeater to only certain user stations is permissible.
(g) The control operator of a repeater that retransmits inadvertently
communications that violate the rules in this Part is not accountable for the violative communications.
Part 97.207 Space station.
(a) Any amateur station may be a space station. A holder of any class
operator license may be the control operator of a space station,

Ch02_Laster_136187-1

subject to the privileges of the class of operator license held by the
control operator.
(b) A space station must be capable of effecting a cessation of transmissions by telecommand whenever such cessation is ordered by
the FCC.
(c) The following frequency bands and segments are authorized to
space stations:
(1) The 17 m, 15 m, 12 m, and 10 m bands, 6 mm, 2 mm, and 1
mm bands; and
(2) The 7.0–7.1 MHz, 14.00–14.25 MHz, 144–146 MHz, 435–438

(a) The station identification procedure is not required for transmissions directed only to the model craft, provided that a label indicating the station call sign and the station licensee’s name and
address is affixed to the station transmitter.
(b) The control signals are not considered codes or ciphers intended
to obscure the meaning of the communication.
(c) The transmitter power must not exceed 1 W.
Part 97.307

Emission standards.

(a) No amateur station transmission shall occupy more bandwidth
than necessary for the information rate and emission type being
transmitted, in accordance with good amateur practices.
(b) Emissions resulting from modulation must be confined to the
band or segment available to the control operator. Emissions

49

Ch02_Laster_136187-1

Page 50

50 CHAPTER TWO
outside the necessary bandwidth must not cause splatter or
keyclick interference to operations on adjacent frequencies.
(c) All spurious emissions from a station transmitter must be reduced
to the greatest extent practicable. If any spurious emission,
including chassis or power line radiation, causes harmful interference to the reception of another radio station, the licensee of
the interfering amateur station is required to take steps to eliminate the interference, in accordance with good engineering practice.
(d) The mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency
below 30 MHz must not exceed 50 MW and must be at least 40 dB
below the mean power of the fundamental emission. For a transmitter of mean power less than 5 W, the attenuation must be at
least 30 dB. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or first marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement.
(e) The mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency
between 30–225 MHz must be at least 60 dB below the mean
power of the fundamental. For a transmitter having a mean power
of 25 W or less, the mean power of any spurious emission supplied to the antenna transmission line must not exceed 25 W (25
microwatts) and must be at least 40 dB below the mean power of
the fundamental emission, but need not be reduced below the
power of 10 W. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or first
marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement.
(f)

The following standards and limitations apply to transmissions
on the frequencies specified in Part 97.305 of this Part:
(1) No angle-modulation (equivalent to frequency modulation)
emission may have a modulation index greater that 1 at the
highest modulating frequency.
(2) No non-phone emission shall exceed the bandwidth of a
communications quality phone emission of the same modulation type. The total bandwidth of an independent sideband emission (having B as the first symbol), or a
multiplexed image and phone emission, shall not exceed
that of a communications quality A3E emission.

(3)

Only a RTTY or data emission having a specified digital
code listed in Part 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted.
The symbol rate must not exceed 300 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the frequency shift between mark and
space must not exceed 1 kHz.

Notes:
1. This section includes the FCC’s technical specifications for modulation characteristics involving voice (phone), RTTY (radio teletypewriter) and data, and image emissions. The defining lines between
RTTY and data forms of communications radio have become somewhat blurred since RTTY, data, and some imaging (TV) signals represent digital signals. For example, one manufacturer markets a
multimode data controller that can be connected between your ham
radio and personal computer. This controller processes the following
signals: Packet, PACTOR, AMTOR, RTTY, Color SSTV TV, FAX,
Weather, ASCII, Navtex, CW, and Memory Keyer. Don’t worry about all
these complex abbreviations—you’ll learn all of them as you progress
in amateur radio. We’ll cover the ones you need to know for the Technician Examination.
2. RTTY and digital code transmission rates are measured in either
bauds or bits per second. A baud may be thought of as a signal transition rate, e.g., 300 baud represents 300 signal transitions per second.
One or more digital bits (usually designated as “ones” or “zeros,” or 1s
and 0s) may be encoded in each signal transition. Thus 1200 baud may
represent 1200 bits per second for one communications system or 4800
bits per second in another communications system. The second system
provides for 4 bits being transmitted during each baud transition.
3. The FCC Rules restrict the baud rates in the lower amateur bands
(mostly HF bands) while permitting higher baud rates in the higher
bands (VHF and UHF). However, Technician Class Amateur operators
are permitted RTTY and data privileges only above 50 MHz. The maximum baud (or symbol) rate for the 2-meter and 6-meter bands is 19.6
kilobauds.
Part 97.313 Transmitter power standards.
(a) An amateur station must use the minimum transmitter power necessary to carry out the desired communications.

(3)

The 3.675–3.725 MHz, 7.10–7.15 MHz, 10.10–10.15 MHz,
and 21.1–21.2 MHz segments;
The 28.1–28.5 MHz segment when the control operator is a
Novice Class operator or a Technician Class operator who
has received credit for proficiency in telegraphy in accordance with the international requirements; or
The 7.050–7.075 MHz segment when the station is within
ITU Regions 1 and 3.

EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS.

The FCC is very specific when it comes to emergency communications. As you may remember, Part 97.1(1) clearly states that one major
justification for the existence of the Amateur Service is its ability to
provide communications during emergency conditions and public service events.
Part 97.401 Operation during a disaster.
(a) When normal communications are overloaded, damaged, or disrupted because a disaster has occurred, or is likely to occur, in an
area where the amateur service is regulated by the FCC, an amateur station may make transmissions necessary to meet essential
communications needs and facilitate relief actions.
(b) When normal communications systems are overloaded, damaged,
or disrupted because a natural disaster has occurred, or is likely to
occur, in an area where the amateur service is not regulated by the
FCC, a station assisting in meeting essential communications
needs and facilitating relief actions may do so only in accordance
with ITU3 Resolution No. 640 (Geneva, 1979). The 80 m, 75 m, 40

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), an agency of the United Nations,
coordinates and establishes radio frequency allocations on a worldwide basis. Region
1 covers Europe, the African Continent, and all of Russia; Region 2 covers the Western
Hemisphere, including North and South America, Greenland, and Hawaii; and Region
3 covers the Far East, including China, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, India, and Pakistan.

m, 30 m, 20 m, 17 m, 15 m, 12 m, and 2 m bands may be used for
these purposes.
(c) When a disaster disrupts normal communications systems in a

Part2 97.501 through 97.527 describes the processes involved in
applying for the entry- and advanced-level amateur licenses. The specific telegraphy (or Morse code) tests and written examinations,
known as “elements,” were summarized in Table 2.1. If you are planning to become a ham, you’ll want to review this table carefully to
become familiar with the entry-level class license—i.e., the Technician Class—requirements. You may elect to start with the No-Code
Technician Class license and enjoy some activity with 2-meter and
440-centimeter repeaters, as well as attending local ham club meetings.

However, if you have an opportunity to also prepare for the Element 1
Morse code test and the Element 2 written examination for the Technician Class license, this is the best of both worlds. For example, code
and theory ham classes offered by the local ham club present an ideal
approach to preparing for Elements 1 and 2 examinations.
Prior to 1984, the FCC administered amateur radio exam at selected
FCC facilities throughout the country. Since that time, the FCC has
delegated the administration of all amateur radio examinations to
qualifying (or accredited) amateurs and amateur organizations such as
the ARRL and the W5YI Group. The amateurs who perform this testing
function are known as volunteer examiners (VEs). The following sections of Part 97 govern the amateur testing sessions for all Technician
(and higher) Class license examinations.
Part 97.501 Qualifying for an amateur operator license. Each
applicant must pass an examination for a new amateur operator
license grant and for each change in operator class. Each applicant for
the class of operator license grant specified below must pass, or otherwise receive examination credit for, the following examination elements:
(a) Amateur Extra Class operator: Elements 1, 2, 3, and 4;
(b) General Class operator: Elements 1, 2, and 3;
(c) Technician Class operator: Element 2.
Part 97.503 Element standards.
(a) A telegraphy examination must be sufficient to prove that the
examinee has the ability to send correctly by hand and to receive
correctly by ear texts in the international Morse code at not less
than the prescribed speed, using the letters of the alphabet,
numerals 0–9, period comma, question mark, slant mark, and
prosigns AR, BT, and SK:
(1) Element 1: 5 words per minute.
(b) A written examination must be sufficient to prove that the examinee possesses the operational and technical qualifications

required to perform properly the duties of an amateur service
licensee. Each written examination must be comprised of a question set as follows:
(1) Element 2: 35 questions concerning the privileges of a Technician Class operator license. The minimum passing score is
26 questions answered correctly.
(2) Element 3: 35 questions concerning the privileges of a General Class operator license. The minimum passing score is 26
questions answered correctly.
(3) Element 4: 50 questions concerning the privileges of a Amateur Extra Class operator license. The minimum passing
score is 37 questions answered correctly.

Amateur Call-Sign Allocations
The FCC assigns a unique amateur radio call sign to each licensed station. Once you receive your call sign, you can retain it for life if you
want to. However, call signs are issued based on the class of license
and the geographical location. When upgrading to a higher license
class such as the Amateur Extra, you may want to request the prestigious call sign assigned to that class of licenses!
The amateur call sign consists of three separate sections: a prefix of
one or two letters (the first one or two letters), a number ranging from
0 to 9 in the center of the call sign, and a suffix of one to three letters
at the end of the call sign.
The prefix and the suffix provide an indication of the license
class—Amateur Extra, Advanced, General, Technician, or Novice. The
numbers and specific letters (L, P, H) serving as the second letter in the
prefix identify the geographical location of the amateur station. Letters
other than L, P, and H, used in the second location of the prefix, permit the numbers 1 through 10 to identify regions within the continental United States. Table 2.2 lists specific numeral designators for
amateur call signs. To distinguish between numbers assigned to continental U.S. regions (i.e., within the 48 states), Alaska and overseas
U.S. locations, the second letter in the prefix is used to provide an
indicator. Here is the key to this designator:

AMATEUR EXTRA CLASS CALL SIGNS

Call signs authorized for Amateur Extra Class stations in the continental United States (Regions 1–10) use a 1  2 format using K, N, or W as
the prefix and a two letter suffix; a 2  1 format using A, N, K, or W as
the first letter in the prefix; and a 2  2 format with an A as the first
letter in the prefix. Examples of call signs for the Amateur Extra Class
licensees from Texas are N5RA and AA5KB.
Call signs authorized for Amateur Extra Class stations in areas
outside the continental United States use unique letter identifiers in
the second position of a two-letter prefix. In Regions 11, 12, and 13,
a special identifier is inserted after the first letter of the prefix. Twoletter suffixes are currently being used. Here are examples of Amateur Extra call signs for stations located outside of the continental
United States:
Region 11:

Prefixes of AL, Kl, NL, or WL
Example: KL7H (Alaska)

Region 12:

Prefixes of KP, NP, or WP
Example: WP3X (Puerto Rico)

Region 13:

Prefixes of AH, KH, NH, or WH
Example: AH4L (Midway Island)

ADVANCED CLASS CALL SIGNS

Although these call signs, a 2  2 format, are no longer issued by the
FCC as of May 15, 2000, holders of current Advanced Class licenses
may retain their licenses indefinitely. The first letter of the prefix may
use K, N, or W. Advanced Class licensees who live outside of the continental United States will use the prefixes AL, KP, or AH to identify
locations in Alaska, islands in the Caribbean, and islands in the
Pacific, respectively.

GENERAL, TECHNICIAN, AND TECHNICIAN WITH HF PRIVILEGES
CALL SIGNS

Call signs for these licensees use a 1  3 format with the first letter of
the prefix being a K, N, or W letter. The General or Technician Class
licensees located outside of the continental United States will be
issued call signs with a 2  3 format with prefixes KL, NL, or WL
(Region 11); NP or WP (Region 12); and KH, NH, or WH (Region 13).
This latter group applies to locations in Alaska, islands in the
Caribbean, and islands in the Pacific, respectively.
NOVICE, CLUB, AND MILITARY RECREATION STATION CALL SIGNS

Although these call signs, a 2  3 format, are no longer issued by the
FCC as of May 15, 2000, holders of current Novice Class licenses may
retain their licenses indefinitely. Novice Class licensees located outside
of the continental United States were issued call signs with a 2  3 format with prefixes KL, NL, or WL (Region 11); NP or WP (Region 12); and
KH, NH, or WH (Region 13). This latter group applies to locations in
Alaska, islands in the Caribbean, and islands in the Pacific, respectively.

How to Learn International Morse Code
If you plan to enter the exciting realm of amateur radio via the Technician Class with HF privileges, the FCC requires that you develop a 5
word per minute (5 WPM) proficiency in Morse code. This first step can
be easy and fun—or it can be difficult and a burden, depending upon
your attitude and study habits. You can get off to a good start in amateur
radio by developing a sound plan of attack for learning the Morse code.
And remember, code (or CW) transmissions will be your means for contacting fellow hams all over the United States and in foreign countries.
One final comment: 5 words per minute is a slow code speed. By
the time you have learned the Morse code, you normally have developed a 5 WPM proficiency. To begin learning this new language, let’s
get started with a complete review of Morse code.

What is Morse Code?
International Morse code, consisting of a series of dits (dots) and dahs,
(dashes), is a universal language complete in itself. It affords a means

Ch02_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:47 PM

Page 59

HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FCC TECHNICIAN CLASS EXAMINATION

of communication between amateur operators on a worldwide basis.
The simplicity of International Morse code transmission is the key to
its tremendous power. It provides you with two very important advantages in radio communications: low-cost equipment for transmitting
and receiving, and the most reliable means of communication. Weak
code signals at the threshold of noise can be copied by experienced
operators when radiotelephone signals are completely unintelligible.
The international Morse code uses individual combinations of dits
and dahs to represent the 26 letters of the alphabet, the 10 numerals (0
through 9), and a group of special symbols and abbreviated expressions. Other texts refer to the combinations of dits and dahs as dots
and dashes. However, educational research has shown that we learn
code faster and more efficiently if the sounds of the code combinations
are associated with the particular characters rather than having to
memorize each character in terms of dots and dashes. By learning code
as dots and dashes, the mind then has to translate the dot-and-dash
combinations to the required character. But by using the dit and dah
approach, the mind can skip the intermediate step of translation. All
but the last dit of a code combination are normally shortened to “di”.
For example, the letter H would be “di-di-di-dit.” The letter R would
be represented by “di-dah-dit.” Table 2.3 provides a complete list of
the recommended International Morse code characters set for amateur
radio communications.

How code is transmitted
Ideal code is always transmitted in dits and dahs of uniform lengths
with uniform spaces between them. The spacing between individual
characters and words is also established at uniform units of time to
permit proper spacing of the received message. Figure 2.3 shows
examples of the proper spacing for the coded characters and words.
This standard is normally used by all proficient amateur and commercial operators. One exception to this standard is that some code practice cassette tapes and phonograph records employ a constant
character transmission rate of about 13 WPM and the spacing between
characters will be lengthened to permit the effective rate of transmission to be slowed down for learning purposes. Some tapes and records
using this approach will provide for recorded code practice sessions of
about 5, 7, and 10 WPM, though each individual character is sent at

the rate of about 13 WPM. The advantage to this approach is that the
beginner learns the sounds of the 13 WPM characters early in his or
her amateur career. For many Novice operators, this is an effective way
to progress to the 13 WPM code requirement for the General license.
Most International Morse code signals are transmitted as CW or
continuous-wave transmissions. Bursts of CW radiofrequency energy
are produced by alternately keying on and off the transmitter carrier
frequency according to the coded character combinations of dits
and dahs.

Who can learn Morse code?
Although some individuals adapt to the code faster than others, almost
everyone can master this fascinating language. The age and educational level of the individual are not significant factors. In fact, some
psychological studies indicate that children under the age of 10 will
adapt to code faster than adolescents or adults. The ranks of amateur

radio range from those less than 10 years of age to those in their 80s
and 90s.
Most people can learn the code in about 10 hours. With another 10
to 20 hours of practice, the average individual can achieve a code proficiency adequate to pass the Novice Class 5 WPM code test. Experience has shown that a code proficiency of about 6 to 7 WPM is
necessary to ensure that the applicant will pass the Novice code test.
The emotional stress encountered in taking a code test tends to reduce
the individual’s code proficiency by some 2 to 3 WPM, so prepare by
practicing at a speed higher than 5 WPM.
LEARNING PLATEAUS

Almost all individuals will experience learning plateaus or periods of
time when they cannot seem to progress to higher code speeds. The
human mind appears to form mental blocks at code speeds which vary
from individual to individual. These plateaus may appear at representative speeds of 6–7, 8–10, 14–16, or 18–20 WPM, or at higher speeds.
You may encounter these learning plateaus at several phases in your
quest to increase your code speed. However, the average Technician
applicant does not normally encounter any plateaus in his/her progression to a speed of 6 to 7 WPM. Later on if you opt for a faster code
proficiency, you may experience these learning plateaus. By being
aware of this potential problem—common to most amateurs—you will
be prepared to cope with it.
Fortunately, there is a solution to the learning-plateau problem—
practice and more practice. After several days of effort, you will find
that the problem will suddenly disappear and you will be able to copy
traffic at the higher speeds.
SCHEDULE PRACTICE SESSIONS

A mandatory requirement for successful code proficiency is a periodic
routine practice schedule. You must establish an adequate schedule
for code practice sessions and rigidly adhere to this schedule. Experience in teaching numerous code and theory classes has shown that the
failure to practice code at routine intervals is the primary factor in failing to achieve the Technician Class with HF privileges license. The
secret to learning the code is practice, practice, and more practice.
As a minimum, you should be prepared to devote about one hour

Ch02_Laster_136187-1

12:47 PM

Page 63

HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FCC TECHNICIAN CLASS EXAMINATION

63

per day, seven days per week, to code practice. It is important that this
be a continuous schedule. Missing one or two days will probably
result in a loss of code proficiency. It is also equally important that you
avoid operating fatigue by taking breaks of about 5 to 10 minutes,
spaced evenly throughout each session. Research in educational techniques indicates that the average individual’s attention span in such
activity is about 15 to 20 minutes.
Many excellent code training aids are available from a variety of
sources. A code-practice oscillator, a hand key, and a source of codepractice signals are considered essential tools for learning to send and
receive International Morse code. Any amateur radio journal will offer
sources for all of these training aids. They are also available from most
local radio parts stores.
A simple code oscillator consisting of a high-frequency buzzer or an
electronic audio oscillator with a loudspeaker are available as kits or
completed items. Building and assembling an audio oscillator is an
excellent first project for your Technician career. Some amateur equipment suppliers offer combination audio oscillator–hand key units. Figure 2.4 shows the MFJ Enterprises, Inc., Model MFJ-557 Code Practice
Oscillator, which can be used for individual as well as group code practice sessions.
It is battery powered and has a small internal speaker. An alternate approach is to
build a “home-brew” code-practice oscillator using the popular Signetics NE555 integrated-circuit (IC) timing chip. (Other
integrated-circuit companies may offer a
direct substitute for the Signetics NE555.)

operation.
The source of code practice signals may be cassette tapes, phonograph records, a computer program for generating practice code on a
PC or other home computer, or an HF-band amateur radio receiver for
on-the-air reception of CW signals. One recommended approach
for individual practice sessions is to obtain a small, inexpensive cassette-tape record/playback unit and one or more Technician code
training tapes. The cassette tape approach offers the advantages of a
stable, uniform source of code-practice signals at specified transmission rates; a capability for recording and playback of the beginner’s
hand-sent code signals; and if an HF-band receiver is available, an
ability to record on-the-air code signals for later playback. Also, the
cassette recorder may be taken to code and theory classes to record

code-practice sessions and discussions of radio theory and FCC rules
and regulations. Some Morse code training tape cassettes are shown
in Fig. 2.6.
W1AW, the ARRL amateur station in Newington, Connecticut,
transmits daily code-practice sessions on a scheduled basis. Approximate frequencies of transmission are 1.818, 3.5815, 7.0475, 14.0475,
18.0975, 21.0675, 28.0675, 50.0675, and 147.555 MHz. Slow code
practice sessions of about 5–15 WPM are scheduled at specific times
during the day to late evening hours, seven days a week. On alternating hours, fast code sessions of about 10–35 WPM are transmitted, also
on a seven-day basis. However, if variations to this schedule are
observed, you can contact the ARRL for the exact schedule. Monthly
schedules for W1AW code transmissions are given in QST, the ARRL
magazine devoted entirely to amateur radio.
BITE-SIZE CODE LESSONS

Most producers of code training tapes or
records recognize that it is almost impossible for the beginner to memorize the International Morse code all at once. They
divide the code set into “bite-size” lessons
for about four or five characters each. Normally, the groups of characters are
arranged to contain similar characters,
such as those with all dits or dahs, and
then progress into the groups of characters
containing combinations of dits and dahs.
A typical series of bite-size code lessons is
given in Table 2.4. You may elect to use
this set of lessons if your code training
tapes (or records) do not contain such an
approach.
HAND COPY OF CODE SIGNALS

The best approach for fast, efficient copy
of code is by longhand writing or using a
typewriter. Although hand printing of
code messages looks more attractive and

is used by many CW operators, it is too
slow for most individuals at the higher
speeds of about 20 WPM and above. Thus,
developing a good habit of copying code
signals as a Technician will help you
when you progress to the higher-class
licenses.
MISSED CHARACTERS

One of the most annoying bad habits
developed by the beginner in copying
code signals is that of being stuck on
missed characters. Sometimes the brain
will simply refuse to recognize a particular character. Other factors, such as an
unexpected noise burst or fatigue from
practicing too long, will cause a person to
lose the power of concentration and therefore miss characters. It is a natural tendency to stop and try to remember what
that particular character was. However,
stopping for one character means missing
the next two, three, or four.
The best approach is to simply ignore
the missed character and concentrate on
the following characters. This will require
an extra effort on your part. One way to
develop this habit is to write in a dash for
the missed character. This helps you to proceed to the next character and “turn loose”
of the one you missed.

ALWAYS INCREASE CODE SPEED DURING PRACTICE

You should never remain fixed on a code speed that can be copied
comfortably and accurately. For example, when you can copy 5 WPM
with some 95 to 100 percent accuracy, it is time to move up to a higher
code speed of about 7–8 WPM. This forces your mind to adapt and
become proficient at the higher speed.

HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FCC TECHNICIAN CLASS EXAMINATION
DON’T IGNORE SENDING PRACTICE

Many beginners make the mistake of neglecting sending practice while
concentrating on receiving practice. The FCC requires proficiency in
both sending and receiving code signals. If available, a cassette tape
recorder can be used to record the sending “fist” for subsequent analysis and improvement. Remember also, the first contact on the Novice
frequencies may be disappointing if you cannot send an intelligent
code message.
Proper sending by a hand key requires a comfortable linkage
between the operator and the key. The spring tension and contact
spacing should be adjusted to suit the individual’s preference. While
operating, the arm should be positioned to rest on a flat surface and the
key should be loosely grasped by the thumb, forefinger, and index finger. Minimum fatigue and more uniform operating will result.

The FCC Written Examinations
The written examination for the Technician Class license, Element 2,
contains 35 questions covering rules and regulations, elementary radio
theory, and operating procedures. You must have a passing score of 26
correct answers to achieve the Technician Class license.

The VEC question pool
Appendix A presents the VEC question pool for the Technician Class
Element 2 license examinations. The question pool covers 10 specific
categories pertinent to the licensing and operation of amateur radio
stations. There are some 384 questions in the pool. Each question is a
multiple-choice type with one correct and three incorrect answers.
Table 2.5 shows the subject areas and number of questions covered by
the Technician Class license examinations.
Your Technician exam questions will be taken from this question
pool, verbatim. Just think about this for a minute—you have a chance
to review and learn every possible question on your Technician Class
license written examination.
Some helpful suggestions for successfully passing the Novice or
Technician written exam are in order. Most people are apprehensive
about taking tests, but knowing some of the pitfalls and reasons for
failing will help you to get through with flying colors.

BE PREPARED

Lack of preparation and study is the primary reason for failing amateur
license examinations. Since the Technician Class examination is the
easiest of all amateur examinations, many beginners do not devote sufficient effort to study and preparation. Being prepared is more than
half of the battle—it gives you a high degree of confidence when it is
time to take the test.
Develop good study habits and a regular schedule for mastering all
of the material anticipated in the exam. A typical schedule may
involve one or two hours of study in a quiet room each day for about
two or three weeks. The actual time required for each individual will
vary, and each person must pace his or her study efforts accordingly.
The important thing to remember is that sufficient time must be
devoted to studying all of the required areas. For example, it is a certainty that the FCC will stress the rules and regulations on all exami-

nations. As you can see from Table 2.5, the Technician Class examination contains nine questions on FCC Rules and five questions on operating procedures. Again, remember that in Appendix A you have
access to the exact questions that will be used.
One suggested study technique used by many beginners in successfully preparing for the Technician examination is to write each
question on one side of an index card and the correct answer on the
reverse side. The process of writing down the information on the cards
results in considerable retention of this material. Then, by constant
review, you can begin to separate the cards into two piles—known and
unknown. After a while, the stack of cards containing unknown
answers will diminish to zero. Oh yes, be sure to go through the entire
stack of cards the night before the examination for a final review.

Scheduling the examination
Be sure to check with the local volunteer examiner (VE) for testing
requirements and to register for the examination at a time convenient
to both parties. You may need to obtain, fill out, and send a form to the
VE for preregistration. If you do not know where the nearest volunteer
examiner team is in your area, contact the local amateur radio club
or the ARRL, Educational Activities Department, 225 Main Street,
Newington, CT 06111.

Taking the examination
Plan to arrive early at the examination point. This will ensure no interruption of examinations in progress and will help you locate a comfortable place to sit. At a minimum, you will need to bring the
following to the exam:
1. Any current amateur radio license and/or certificate of successful
completion of examination.
2. Two documents for identification purposes. This may include a
current amateur radio license, a photo ID such as a driver’s license,
or a birth certificate.
3. Several sharpened No. 2 pencils, an eraser, and two pens (black
or blue ink). If a pocket calculator is available, bring it along for
possible mathematical calculations. However, if a programmable

69

Ch02_Laster_136187-1

12:47 PM

Page 70

70 CHAPTER TWO
calculator is used, be sure it is cleared of all instructions and constants. Ask the VE for blank paper to write out such items as calculations and formulas.
4. Finally, don’t forget to bring the testing fee (about $6–7). Check
with your VE on this point.
Carefully read the FCC instructions on the examination. Fill out all
requested information, including signatures, before proceeding. Check
the exam to ensure that all pages are included. If some are missing,
report this to the VE immediately. Check the question numbers.
Read each question thoroughly before attempting to answer it.
Remember, a multiple-choice exam requires a careful screening of all
answers to decide on the most correct one. If the question cannot be
answered correctly after the first deliberation, move on to the next one.
In this manner, the easy questions can be answered and you can return
to the more difficult ones for additional study. In many instances, this
delay in tackling the tough questions gives the mind a chance to recall
the correct answer. Also, some subsequent questions may relate to the
one you are having trouble with. Most volunteer examiners will allow
any reasonable length of time for completing the exam.
At the end of the test, carefully check to ensure that all questions
have been answered. Go back over each answer to be 100 percent sure
that the most correct answer has been given. Some test-takers fail
because of carelessness in answering questions, though they may
know the required material. When this final check is finished, return
the exam to the VE.
If by some chance you fail the examination, chalk this up to experience and try again. The FCC allows you to retake the test at any time
convenient to the VE. Good luck!

Radio Communications Theory

T

he ability to transmit and receive radio waves is a fascinating subject. In this chapter we will take a close look at some of the fundamentals of radio communication. Learning these principles will help
you to pass the Technician Class license examination and to understand how amateur radio signals are propagated for long distances.

Definitions
Sky-wave propagation A type of radio-wave propagation in which
radio waves traveling upward are bent or refracted by the ionosphere
back to the earth. This is one of the major means of amateur communication in the high-frequency spectrum. Otherwise, these radio waves
would be propagated into outer space and lost. Sky-wave propagation
provides a capability for long-range or DX communications using one
or more “hops” in which the radio waves are reflected back to the earth.
Ground-wave propagation Another form of propagation in which
the ground or surface wave travels along the surface of the ground or
water. This mode of propagation is important at the low and medium
frequencies. Most commercial AM broadcast stations use ground-wave
propagation during daylight hours for local urban and suburban coverage. However, beginning at about 3 MHz, ground-wave propagation
at distances greater than 100 miles (or about 160 kilometers) becomes
impractical.

72 CHAPTER THREE
Refraction of radio waves Radio waves, like light waves, are
refracted or bent when they pass from one medium to another medium
with a different density. Since radio waves traveling upward experience less atmospheric density, they may be curved or bent. This is
related to sky-wave propagation.
Sunspot cycle The sun exhibits a periodic 11-year cycle of
increasing and decreasing sunspots which affect radio communications on earth. Scientists have recorded the number of sunspots
appearing on the surface of the sun for the past 300 years and have
determined that the number of sunspots reaches a maximum about
every 11 years. Also, the number of sunspots will vary during each
maximum and minimum cycle. The maximums may range from about
60 to over 200 while minimums may drop to almost zero.
During maximum sunspot activity, excellent amateur communications in the bands up to and including the 10-meter band are possible.
However, during minimum sunspot activity, long-range communication is almost nil in the 15- and 10-meter bands. Also, 20-meter operation is restricted primarily to daylight operation.
Skip distance The skip distance is associated with sky-wave propagation for the most part. It is defined as the distance between the transmitter location and the point that the skywave returns to earth after
striking the ionosphere. Except for the limited area subject to groundwave reception, the skip distance or zone does not allow for communications because no radio waves are reflected or bent into this zone.
Wavelength The wavelength of a radio-frequency signal is defined
as the length in meters of that signal. More specifically, it is the length
of one complete cycle of the radio wave. Thus, a 10-meter signal or
wave is approximately 10 meters in length (or about 32.8 feet). For
example, a quarter-wave vertical antenna for 10 meters would be
approximately 2.5 meters (or about 8.2 feet) of vertical distance.
Frequency Frequency is defined as the number of complete
cycles per second that a radio signal exhibits in passing from a value
of maximum intensity, through zero intensity, and back to the original
value of intensity. Frequency is measured in hertz (or simply Hz),
which is directly equivalent to cycles per second; that is, 1 Hz equals
1 cycle per second.
Frequency is related to wavelength and may be used interchangeably to describe the wave motion of a radio wave. Frequency can be

Ch03_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:48 PM

Page 73

RADIO COMMUNICATIONS THEORY

converted to wavelength in meters by dividing the frequency in hertz
into 300,000,000. For example, 7150 kHz (which is 7,150,000 Hz) corresponds to a wavelength of 41.96 meters.
Ionosphere The ionosphere consists of layers of ionized air at
heights above the surface of the earth ranging from about 7 to 250 miles
(or about 11 to 402 kilometers). This ionization of the rarefied air particles is caused by the ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The heights of
these layers vary from daylight to darkness, depending on the position
of the sun with respect to the surface of the earth. A more detailed
description of the ionosphere will be given later in this chapter.

The Radio Circuit—Transmitter to Receiver
Radio is defined as the transmission and reception of communications
signals through space by means of electromagnetic waves. These communications signals contain intelligence conveyed by such forms as
code, voice, television images, teleprinter, and computer-to-computer
operation in digital form. Noncommunications electronics systems
that use electromagnetic radiation include radar, navigation aids, and
identification devices.
Figure 3.1 illustrates a generalized model of a radio communications system. The source of intelligence can be code being generated
by a telegraph key or a microphone picking up the sounds of human
speech. This intelligence, when applied to the modulator, varies the
transmitter’s radio-frequency (RF) output energy by the modulation
method being used. In the case of code transmissions, the key can be
used to switch on and off the carrier frequency of the transmitter,
resulting in a series of dits and dahs containing the required information. Voice modulation schemes can employ amplitude or frequency
modulation.
The RF power output levels from transmitters can range from a few
watts to hundreds or thousands of watts. This RF energy is converted
to electromagnetic or radio waves by the transmitting antenna. With
proper matching between the transmitter, transmission line, and the
antenna, most of the RF output of the transmitter will be used to generate radio waves.
In most communications systems, particularly in the high-frequency (HF) spectrum, the propagation path loss or attenuation is

tremendous. Sky-wave propagation can reduce the transmitted signal
power level from many watts to micromicrowatts at the receiving
antenna. The radio receiver must have sufficient sensitivity to detect
and amplify these weak signals for demodulation and conversion to
the required output such as audio speech or code signals.
Radio communications depend on many factors for reliable performance. Some of these factors are the RF power output levels, the
antenna directivity and gain characteristics, the radio frequencies
being used and the related propagation characteristics at these frequencies, and the receiver performance. An ever-increasing number of
transmitters in the already crowded spectrum, as well as interference
from nonintentional emitters, also adds to the problems of achieving
reliable radio communications. These factors are explored in detail
beginning in this chapter.

The Electromagnetic Spectrum
The electromagnetic spectrum, as defined by modern science, ranges
from extremely long radio waves to ultrashort cosmic rays. Between

characteristic of most ac signals and electromagnetic waves. One complete cycle
consists of the wave starting at a reference point such as zero amplitude, traveling through a positive and negative value, and returning to
the original reference value, zero in this example.
Frequency is defined as the number of complete cycles generated
in one second and is expressed in hertz (or simply Hz), which equals
cycles per second. Thus 60 Hz, the frequency of ac electrical power
used in most homes and manufacturing plants, consists of 60 complete
cycles of alternating current each second. Figure 3.4 illustrates the 60Hz power-line frequency.
Radio-frequency signals and electromagnetic waves are measured
in terms of thousands, millions, and billions of hertz. For convenience

Wavelength is defined as the physical length of one complete cycle
of an electromagnetic wave traveling in free space. For example, a 10meter radio wave in free space exhibits a physical length of 10 meters
(or about 32.8 feet) for each complete cycle of the wave.
Because electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light
(300,000,000 meters per second) in free space, the frequency of the
wave in complete cycles per second (or Hz) can be determined by
dividing 300,000,000 by the wavelength in meters. Also, if the frequency of a wave is known, the wavelength can be determined by
dividing 300,000,000 by the frequency in hertz. These relationships or
equations can be expressed as follows:
A. To find frequency of a radio wave when wavelength is known:

where

is the wavelength in meters.

(Eq. 3.2)

Two examples are given to show these relationships. Remember,
always convert frequency in kilohertz or megahertz to hertz or Equation 3.2 will not give the correct wavelength.

This is the first occasion in this book to use a little mathematics, and
some comments may be in order to help you become more proficient in
the use of “math” in amateur radio computations. The need for mathematical computations in the written examinations for the Technician
Class license is extremely limited. However, examinations for the
higher class licenses will require more use of mathematical computations. We recommend that you become familiar with the basic equations used in amateur radio. This will help you in constructing
antennas for specific operating frequencies, the design of “home-brew”
equipment, and other aspects of amateur radio. Another suggestion is
to obtain a “scientific” style pocket calculator. While most simple
pocket calculators will help with the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the more serious amateur will
want to make calculations involving squares, square roots, logarithms,
and trigonometric functions. Don’t let these last math expressions
alarm you: much information concerning them can be learned simply
by following the instructions furnished with each calculator.

The radio frequency spectrum
Radio frequencies are defined as ranging from about 10,000 Hz (10
kHz) to 300,000,000,000 Hz (300 GHz), with the upper limit approaching infrared and visible-light radiation. The radio spectrum is divided
into designated bands, which exhibit individual characteristics such
as propagation and methods of generation and detection. Table 3.1
lists these bands and their respective frequency ranges.
No amateur communications are permitted in the VLF band (3 to 30
kHz). Operation in this band is limited primarily to radio navigation
aids, time-frequency standard stations, and military, maritime, and
aeronautical communications. Limited, mostly experimental, amateur
communications is permitted in the 160–190 kHz portion of the LF

band (30 to 300 kHz). The bulk of amateur radio communications
starts in the 1800–2000 kHz portion of the MF band and extends
through the EHF band.
Each band of amateur frequencies offers a distinct challenge in
terms of radio propagation characteristics and types of equipment to
be used. Sky-wave propagation, useful in the HF band for long-range
communications, is almost nonexistent in the VHF frequencies and
above. Components and construction techniques used in equipment
for MF or HF frequencies are not always applicable for VHF and UHF
frequencies. For example, a capacitor may act as a capacitor at HF frequencies but may exhibit qualities of inductance at VHF or UHF frequencies. Many transistors will simply not operate at VHF or UHF
frequencies.

Types of Propagation
Electromagnetic or radio waves are transmitted from one point to
another via one or more of the following propagation paths: ground
waves, sky waves, direct waves, and reflected waves. Amateur radio
communications on the HF frequency bands rely primarily on sky-

Ch03_Laster_136187-1

12:48 PM

Page 81

RADIO COMMUNICATIONS THEORY

and ground-wave propagation. Communications on VHF and higher
band frequencies use mostly direct- or reflected-wave propagation.
Let’s examine each of these modes of propagation and see how they
apply to amateur radio operation, particularly in the HF bands.
Ground radio waves from the transmitting antenna travel along the
surface of the earth. In the HF bands and above, the radio waves are
attenuated by the earth’s surface and rarely extend beyond 20 to 30
miles (or about 30 to 50 kilometers). Thus amateur radio communications in the HF bands and above cannot rely on ground-wave propagation over long distances.
Virtually all long-range amateur radio communications from 80 to 10
meters are accomplished by sky-wave propagation. The HF radio waves
radiated into space from the transmitting antenna, are refracted from the
ionosphere back to the earth’s surface. Figure 3.6 illustrates groundwave and sky-wave propagation at the HF frequencies. There is a weak
signal area between the point of transmission and the point of return to
earth for the refracted waves: this area is referred to as the skip zone or
skip distance. Signal reception in the skip zone is virtually impossible,

particularly in the HF bands above 40-meters. Be sure you are familiar
with ground- and sky-wave propagation because the FCC Technician
Class examinations will include questions on these subjects.
Beginning with the VHF and UHF frequencies, direct and reflected
waves are the major modes of propagation. Figure 3.7 shows an example of a particular transmission with both direct and reflected waves.
Most of the reliable communications at these frequencies are often
referred to as line-of-sight propagation of the direct wave. This simply
means that the transmitting antenna must be able to “see” the receiving antenna with no intervening obstructions. Some forms of longrange propagation modes are experienced at these higher frequencies.
Occasional skip distances of up to 2500 miles (about 4000 kilometers)
or more are encountered in the amateur bands at VHF and UHF frequencies due to abnormal atmospheric conditions.

(50 to 80 kilometers) above the earth. The ionosphere differs from other
regions of rarefied air in that it contains large numbers of free ions
(charged particles) and electrons. The creation of these layers of
charged particles and electrons is attributed to the intense radiation of
the sun. The layers of the ionosphere extend up to about 250 miles (400
kilometers), depending on the intensity of the radiation of the sun.
The rotation of the earth on its axis, the orbital journey of the earth
around the sun, and varying sunspot activity on the surface of the sun
will result in a constant changing of the layers of charged particles in
the ionosphere. It is the nature of the ionosphere that affects the quality and distance of radio communications.

Ionospheric layers
Up to four distinct layers of ionized or charged particles can be present
in the ionosphere at any one time. Each layer consists of varying densities of charged particles ranging from an intense density in the inner
region to very little density at the outer regions. Above 250 miles (400
kilometers), the number of air particles in the atmosphere is too small
to permit the formation of any sizable concentration of charged particles that would affect radio communications. At altitudes below 40
miles (64 kilometers), the intensity of the radiation of the sun is
reduced, or attenuated, by the ionosphere and little potential remains
to create more charged particles.
During daylight hours, the radiation of the sun produces four
ionospheric layers: the D layer ranging from about 40 to 50 miles (64 to
80 kilometers); the E layer from about 50 to 90 miles (80 to 145 kilometers); the F1 layer at about 140 miles (225 kilometers); and the F2
layer at about 200 miles (320 kilometers). The ionization intensity of
these layers rises to a maximum level about midday, local time.
At sunset, a transition of the ionospheric layers begins to take place.
The D layer disappears, the F1 and F2 layers combine into a single
layer, and the ionization intensity of these two layers is reduced. Figure
3.8 illustrates both the day and night composition of the ionosphere.

Sunspots affect the ionosphere
The presence of sunspots on the surface of the sun has a marked influence on radio communications. Sunspots are dark areas on the surface
of the sun, sometimes appearing in groups covering areas of up to

100,000 miles (160,000 kilometers) in diameter. They appear to be
solar storms, resembling earth tornadoes. A sunspot can develop in a
matter of hours, persist for a few weeks, and then break up into a number of smaller spots. Associated with the sunspots are intense magnetic fields or disturbances.
Sunspots affect the intensity of the radiation of the sun, including
ultraviolet waves. During periods of high sunspot activity, the radiation of the sun increases producing more intense ionization of the
atmosphere. At approximate 11-year intervals, the number of sunspots
builds up to a maximum ranging from about 60 to 200. During minimum sunspot activity, the number of sunspots can decrease to zero for
short periods of time.

High sunspot activity
High sunspot activity results in more skywave propagation at the
higher HF frequencies. The highest usable frequency is normally
referred to as the maximum usable frequency (MUF). During this
period, the MUF will extend to the 10-meter band and beyond, providing reliable communications paths. The MUF is reduced to about
the 20-meter band during periods of minimum sunspot activity. Only
sporadic activity is available at 15 meters, and the 10-meter band is
essentially “dead” except for local activity.
Sunspot activity has been observed for some 250 years, with accurate measurements being recorded in the last 150 years. The last two

periods of maximum sunspot activity, known as Sunspot Cycles 22
and 23, began in 1986 and 1999, respectively. Current sunspot activity
is available from time standard stations WWV at Ft. Collins, Colorado,
and WWVH at Kauai, Hawaii—both stations transmit continually on
frequencies of 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, and 20 MHz. Most amateur receivers
will provide reception on 10 MHz to permit monitoring of WWV and
WWVH.

Propagation characteristics of the ionosphere
During daylight hours, sky-wave energy of the 160- and 80-meter amateur bands is almost completely absorbed by the D layer. Only highangle radiation can penetrate the D layer and be reflected back to earth
by the E layer. This restricts operation on these bands to about 150 to
250 miles (240 to 400 kilometers). The remaining HF amateur bands
experience very little D-layer absorption.
The E layer is probably the best region in the ionosphere for reliable sky-wave propagation. Distances of up to about 1200 miles
(2000 kilometers) in one-hop transmissions are common for frequencies up to about 20 MHz. Sporadic E ionization, or occasional erratic
regions of E-layer ionization, permits propagation of radio waves
with frequencies extending well into the VHF band. Sometimes
referred to as “short skip,” this phenomenon is most prevalent in the
northern hemisphere during summer months and in the southern
hemisphere during winter months. Transmission paths range from
about 4000 to 1300 miles (650 to 2100 kilometers) for single-hop
transmissions and up to 2500 miles (400 kilometers) or more for multihop paths.
Most HF waves penetrating the E layer also pass through the F1
layer and are reflected by the F2 layer, the outermost region of the
ionosphere. The F2 layer is the principal reflecting region for longdistance HF communications, providing for international or worldwide transmission paths. Frequencies involved in F2 transmission
range from about 20 MHz to as high as 70 MHz during high sunspot
activity. At this time, excellent band openings on 10 and 6 meters are
available for multihop paths of up to 12,000 miles (20,000 kilometers) or more. However, this capability decreases with diminishing
sunspot activity and becomes almost nonexistent during minimum
activity.

Nighttime propagation conditions
The disappearance of the D layer after sunset allows the 160- and 80meter amateur band waves to pass unobstructed to the E and F layers.
Sky-wave propagation at these bands increases to distances of about
2500 miles (4000 kilometers) by F-layer reflections.
The E layer loses most of its ionization properties after sunset and
has very little effect on HF propagation. However, occasional sporadicE regions may be present and contribute to propagation paths well into
the VHF frequencies.
Shortly after sunset, the F1 and F2 layers combine into a single
layer with slowly decreasing ionization levels. This results in a lowering of the MUF to the 40-meter band for amateur communications.
Table 3.2 lists the primary modes of propagation in the amateur
bands. Space does not permit a complete description of all modes of
propagation involved in radio communications. Also, for purposes of
brevity, the distances are given in miles. To convert to meters, multiply the distance in miles by 1.61.

T

he study of electricity and magnetism provides a foundation for
almost every aspect of radio communications. The basic principles
of electrical current flow are used to describe the action of resistors,
capacitors, and inductors in ac and dc circuits. The concepts of electromagnetism, for example, can be used to explain the operation of
power-line, voice, or radio-frequency transformers.
The material in this chapter is designed to help you learn enough
basic theory and practical knowledge for the FCC Technician Class
examinations and subsequent operation of your Technician amateur
station. You will also find that this theory and practical information
will be helpful in understanding the operation of vacuum tubes, transistors, amplifiers, and other radio circuits. Finally, mastering the
material in this and subsequent chapters will lay the foundation for
your study of more advanced amateur license examinations.

Definitions
Alternating current Alternating current (ac) is a flow of current
that alternates or reverses its direction of flow on a periodic basis. The
ac power used in most homes in the United States exhibits a complete
reversal of current flow 60 times per second. Thus, the frequency of

this ac power can be described as 60 cycles per second or 60 hertz
(Hz).The unit of current is the ampere.
Capacitance Capacitance is defined as the ability to store electrical energy by means of an electrical field. In a physical sense, a capacitor consists of two conductors (such as two parallel metal plates)
separated by an insulator known as a dielectric. The dielectric can be
waxed paper, ceramic, air, or other insulating material. The unit of
capacitance is the farad.
Direct current Direct current (dc) can be described as a flow of
current in one direction only. For example, a battery forces current to
flow in an electrical circuit in one direction only.
Electrical power Expressed in units of watts (W), electrical power
is the rate at which electricity is performing work. Electrical power
can be converted to heat when a current flows in a resistor or to physical motion when current flows in an electric motor.
Electromotive force Electromotive force (emf) can be described as
a difference in potential, or voltage, which forces the flow of current in
a conductor. It is analogous to pressure in a water pipe that forces water
to flow through the pipe. The unit of electromotive force is the volt.
Frequency Frequency is used to describe the number of alternating cycles of an ac current flow in one second, or the number of complete wave cycles per second of an electromagnetic wave. The basic
unit of frequency is the cycle per second, usually referred to as a hertz.
Related terms are:
1 Kilohertz (kHz) = 1000 Hz.
1 Megahertz (MHz) = 1,000,000 Hz.
INDUCTANCE Inductance implies an ability to store electrical energy

by means of a magnetic field. Current passing through an inductor or
coil creates magnetic lines of force. The inductance of a coil can be
defined in terms of the number of magnetic lines of force generated by
a unit of current flowing in the coil. The unit of inductance is the
henry.
RESISTANCE Resistance is simply the opposition to the flow of
current. Resistance is measured in units of ohms.

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGENTISM

Fundamentals of Electricity
The first recorded observation of electricity was made in ancient
Greece about 2600 years ago. Thales of Miletus discovered that when
amber was rubbed with a wool cloth, it would attract small bits of
straw. However, this discovery would go unnoticed until the sixteenth
century. William Gilbert, an English physicist, made a detailed study
of Thales’ observations and found that many substances such as hard
rubber and glass would exhibit this force of attraction. Because the
Greek word for amber is elektron, Gilbert proposed that this attractive
force be called electricity.
By the eighteenth century, scientists had discovered two types of
electrical charges, which were designated as positive and negative.
This led to the development of a fundamental law of electricity, the
law of charges. Simply stated, the law of charges governs the behavior
of particles of matter possessing electrical charge: Like Charges
Repel—Unlike Charges Attract.
Figure 4.1 illustrates the basic principles involved in the law of
charges. You will find this fundamental law of electricity useful in
describing the flow of electrical current in conductors, capacitors,
inductors, transistors, and other components.

Atoms and matter
Near the end of the nineteenth century, most of the basic laws of electricity had been discovered and documented. The scientists involved
in this field knew the effects of electricity, but not the cause or origin.
The battery, motor, generator, electric lamp, telegraph, telephone, and
even the wireless had been invented before science could explain the
nature of electricity.
The atomic theory of matter, developed jointly by chemists and
physicists, brought about the first plausible explanation of electricity.
All matter can be described primarily in terms of elements that are
composed of varying numbers of electrons, protons, and neutrons—
the basic building blocks of nature. There are 104 different elements
known to date, ranging from the simple atoms of hydrogen and
helium to the more complex atoms of silicon, copper, and californium. Figure 4.2 shows models of the hydrogen and helium atoms.
Unfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions and
incomplete explanations regarding the current theory for the atomic
structure of matter. Many other subatomic particles have been discovered or postulated to account for certain inconsistencies observed to
date. The dual nature of the electron, acting alternately as a solid particle of matter and as a wave of energy cannot be explained. Fortunately
for the electronics field, the present theory of atomic structure provides
an adequate and reasonable explanation for the nature of electricity.

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGENTISM

Negative and positive charges
Electrons are tiny particles of matter that possess a negative electric
charge, sometimes referred to as a “unit of electric charge.” Electrons
normally travel in specified orbits around the nucleus of an atom. Electrons in the inner orbits are tightly bound to the atoms while electrons
in an outer orbit might be loosely held to the atom. Under the influence
of external energy such as heat, an outer orbit electron might escape
from the parent atom and become a “free electron.” This represents a
negative charge lost by the atom, making the atom positively charged.
Protons and neutrons are tiny particles contained within the nucleus
of the atom. Each proton possesses a positive electric charge, equal and
opposite to that of the electron. However, the proton has a mass about
1800 times the mass of the electron. The neutron, which has no electric
charge, has a mass approximately equal to the mass of the proton.

Electricity—the flow of electrons
When an atom loses an electron, the free electron becomes mobile and
acts as a moving negative charge. In a material such as copper, many
free electrons are created and are free to move in random directions
throughout the material. These electrons eventually collide with
atoms or other electrons, losing or gaining energy in the process. The
atom releasing an electron becomes a positive ion, which is not free to
move about in a solid material.
The movement of the free electrons, each with a negative charge,
does not affect the total electric charge on the material. We still have an
equal number of positive ions in the material that balances out the number of free electrons. In fact, a free electron colliding with a positive ion
can recombine to form a normal or neutral atom.
The type of material and its ambient temperature are the major factors that determine the number of free electrons present at any given
time. At normal room temperature, materials such as silver, copper, and
gold possess a large number of free electrons. For example, copper has
about 1.4 × 1024 free electrons per cubic inch (16.4 cubic centimeters) at
normal room temperature. (This extremely large number is equal to 14
followed by 23 zeros!) Figure 4.3A shows the random movement of free
electrons in a piece of copper wire.
The availability of large numbers of free electrons allows the flow of
negative charge within a material. When we connect the copper wire to
a battery as shown in Fig. 4.3B, this creates a potential difference or

93

Ch04_Laster_136187-1

Page 94

94 CHAPTER FOUR
voltage across the wire. The negatively charged electrons are immediately attracted to the positive pole of the battery while the negative pole
repels the electrons. The flow of electrons through the copper wire constitutes a current. In a practical sense, connecting a copper wire across
a battery would rapidly drain the battery.
These forces of attraction and repulsion can be thought of as electrical pressure, similar to pressure in a water pipe that forces water
through the pipe. Current can be thought of as analogous to the amount
of water flowing in the pipe at any one time.

Units of voltage and current
The unit of potential difference or voltage is the volt. Sometimes voltage is referred to as electromotive force or emf. Voltage levels in electronic equipment might vary from microvolts (one microvolt is equal to
0.000001 volt) to the kilovolt level (1000 volts). The instrument used to
measure voltage is the voltmeter. Voltmeters are available in many
types including the VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter), VTVM (vacuumtube voltmeter), and the TVM (transistorized voltmeter).
The flow of electrical charge or current in a conductor is defined in
units of amperes. Like voltage levels, current in electronic circuits can

vary from microamperes (0.000001 ampere) to many amperes. Current
meters, called ammeters, are used to measure current.

Conductors and insulators
In electrical terms, all materials can be divided into two basic
categories—conductors and insulators. Conductors possess large numbers of free electrons and are capable of conducting sizable amounts of
electrical current. Silver is the best conductor, followed closely by copper, gold, and aluminum.
Materials that have very few free electrons are known as insulators. Almost all of the electrons in the outer atomic orbits of these
materials are tightly bound in their orbits. Glass, wood, plastics, air,
and distilled water fall into this category. Electrons can only be dislodged from their orbits when extremely high voltage levels are
placed across these materials. For example, air is an efficient insulator until subjected to a voltage level of about 30,000 volts per centimeter (or about 76,000 volts per inch). Mica, one of the best known
insulators, will withstand voltage levels of about 2,000,000 volts per
centimeter (or about 5,000,000 volts per inch) before it breaks down
and acts as a conductor.
An “in-between” group of materials, being neither good conductors
nor insulators, includes resistors and semiconductors. Resistors are
simply materials with a limited number of free electrons and are used
for controlling current in a circuit. The action of semiconductors is
covered in Chap. 5.

Resistance and resistors
Resistance can be considered as opposition to the flow of current in a
circuit. In the water pipe analogy, the size of the pipe controls the
amount of water that can flow for a given pressure. A smaller pipe
restricts the flow of water. Similarly, a conductor having fewer free
electrons restricts the flow of current for a given voltage.
The flow of free electrons in a material as a result of an applied
voltage is opposed by force similar to friction. This opposition is due
to the countless number of collisions between the free electrons and
atoms in the material. Energy in the form of heat is generated, raising
the temperature of the material. If the voltage applied to the material is
to a critical level, the amount of heat can raise the temperature past the

Page 96

96 CHAPTER FOUR
melting point of the material. At this point, the material will vaporize
and the electrical component will be destroyed or damaged. For example, applying too much voltage across a lamp or flashlight bulb will
burn out the filament.
The unit of resistance is the ohm. Resistors used in electronic circuits can possess values of resistance ranging from less than one ohm
to millions of ohms (or megohms). The values of many units in electronics vary over a wide range. A list of standard numerical expressions is given in Table 4.1. These terms apply to voltage, current,
resistance, and many other electrical units.
Resistors are available in many types and sizes, and can have
either fixed or variable values. Figure 4.4 shows some of the typical
resistors used in amateur radio equipment. The resistors shown on
the left are fixed power types and are usually wirewound. The fixed
carbon composition resistors in the center range from 1⁄8 watt to 2
watts. Variable resistors and potentiometers are shown on the right.
Other fixed resistors include metal film, oxide, and film-chip types
with power ratings of 1⁄16 to 1 watt. The size of the resistor usually
indicates the power rating, and the color bands or stripes provide a
coding for the value of resistance and tolerance factor. Table 4.2
shows the color-code scheme used for these types of resistors. The
values of resistances normally vary from 2.7 ohms to 22 megohms. In

some instances, carbon composition resistors with values of one ohm
or less are available.
The tolerance factor of a resistor indicates the range that the resistance value can vary due to manufacturing differences. Carbon composition resistors are available with tolerances of 5% (gold band), 10%
(silver band), and 20% (no tolerance band). For example, a 1-KΩ (or
1000-ohm) resistor with a tolerance of 10% might vary from 900 ohms
to 1100 ohms and still be in tolerance. Resistors with low tolerance ratings cost more and generally are not used unless the circuit requires a
more precise value of resistance. Special resistors with tolerance factors of 1% or less are available for special applications.
Variable resistors are available either as rheostats (two-terminal
devices) or potentiometers (three terminals). The rheostat is simply a
resistor capable of being adjusted over a specified range of resistance.
The potentiometer, as the name implies, is a variable potential device
acting as a voltage-divider network. The potentiometer is used to control the level of voltage being applied to a circuit element. For example, a potentiometer might serve as a volume control in a receiver,
allowing the level of the audio signals to be varied as desired.
The instrument used to measure the resistance of a resistor or
between any two points of an electrical circuit is the ohmmeter.

Some Basic Electrical Laws
So far we have covered voltage, current, and resistance, the three basic
electrical units used in electrical measurements. These three units are
interrelated; you can’t change one of these units in a particular circuit
without changing the others. Figure 4.5 shows a simple circuit consisting of a battery and a resistor. When we apply one volt across a oneohm resistor, we find that one ampere of current flows in this circuit.
George Simon Ohm, a German school teacher, set up a similar circuit
in 1828 and discovered this relationship.

Ohm’s law
Ohm’s law is often referred to as the foundation of electricity. It can be
applied to the flow of current in a single resistor or to a complex circuit involving many series- and parallel-connected resistors. The relationship between current, voltage, and resistance can be expressed by
the following simple equation:
I

V
amperes
R

(Eq. 4.1)

where
I is the current in amperes
V is the voltage in volts
R is the resistance in ohms
This equation is useful for solving for current when the voltage and
resistance values are known. For example, if you connect a 10-ohm
resistor across a 12-volt battery, the resulting current flow is 12/10, or
1.2 amperes. Ohm’s law can be restated in two additional equations
when solving for voltage or current:
To find voltage when current and resistance values are given:
V  I × R volts

(Eq. 4.2)

To find resistance when voltage and current values are given:
R

V
ohms
I

When you use Ohm’s law, you must
express voltage, current, and resistance in
units of volts, amperes, and ohms, respectively. Current, for example, cannot be
expressed in units of milliamperes or
microamperes. All such values must be
converted to the basic units of measurement. The following example illustrates
the use of Ohm’s law.

of the parallel combination is equal to the value of any one resistor
divided by the number of resistors. For example, if four 100-ohm resistors
are connected in parallel, the resulting resistance is 100/4, or 25 ohms.

resulting resistance is found by the following equation:

Figure 4.7 illustrates parallel combinations of resistors and examples for computing these different cases.

Series-parallel combinations
Any complex combination of series and parallel resistors can be
reduced to a single equivalent resistance. In general, you determine
the equivalent resistance of each parallel combination separately as a
first step. Then add up all of these equivalent resistances to find the
total circuit resistance. Sometimes it helps to redraw the circuit at
each step. Figure 4.8 shows an example of reducing a complex network to a single value of resistance.

Current flow in series dc circuits
The current flowing in a series dc circuit is the same level at any
point in the circuit. For example, in Fig. 4.9, the current leaving the
positive terminal of the battery is equal to the current flowing
through the resistor. In this simple circuit, Ohm’s law can be used to
compute the circuit current. This type of circuit is referred to as a
direct-current or dc circuit because the current flows only in one
direction.

When two or more batteries and resistors are connected in a series
circuit, such as Fig. 4.10A, the total circuit voltage and resistance must
be determined before the current can be computed. This bring us to a
new concept—how battery voltages are added in a series circuit. The
following steps are used to analyze this circuit:
■ Batteries connected in series-aiding have a total voltage equal to

the sum of the individual batteries. In this case, batteries A and
B are connected in series-aiding and their resulting voltage is 12
+ 6, or 18 volts.
■ Batteries connected in series-opposing have a total voltage

equal to the difference of the individual batteries. The resulting polarity of the combination is equal to the polarity of the
higher battery voltage. Thus in Fig. 4.10A, the AB combination
of 18 volts is opposing the 6 volts of battery C. The three bat-

IR voltage drops
This brings us to another new concept—the voltage across any resistor
in a series circuit is equal to the current times the resistance (from
Ohm’s law). This gives us a powerful tool for computing the voltage at
any point in a series circuit. Figure 4.10C shows the voltage across
each resistor based on a current of 0.1 ampere.
If you add up the voltage drops in a series circuit, you find that
their sum is equal to the source voltage. In Fig. 4.10C, note that the IR

Ch04_Laster_136187-1

drops of 3, 3.5, 0.5, 2, and 3 volts are equal to the effective source voltage of 12 volts.

Current flow in parallel dc circuits
When two resistors are connected in parallel across a battery, the current flowing through each resistor depends on the resistance encountered. Consider the circuit in Fig. 4.11. The battery voltage across
resistor R1 is the same as the voltage across resistor R2. However, the
current through R1 is 12/24, or 0.5 ampere and the current through R2
is 12/12 or 1.0 ampere. Therefore, the battery must supply a total of 0.5
and 1.0, or 1.5 amperes to the parallel network.
This simple example demonstrates an important concept in current
flow—the current entering a parallel network is equal to the sum of the
individual branch currents within the network. At point A in Fig. 4.11,
the total current IT supplied by the battery is equal to the sum of I1 and
I2, the individual branch currents.
You can use this concept to compute the current flow in any seriesparallel network. First, it is necessary to compute the total circuit
resistance and the total current flowing in the circuit. The second step
is to compute the IR voltage drop across each parallel network. After
this is done, the currents in each parallel network can readily be computed. Note that most of these computations use different variations of
Ohm’s law.

106 CHAPTER FOUR
Magnetism
The attraction and repulsion properties of magnets are similar to those
described previously for electrical forces. Recorded history of experiments with natural magnets dates back some 2600 years to when the
early Greek scientists described the magnetic properties of an ore
material. This material, known as magnetite or lodestone, is the only
substance occurring in nature that possesses magnetic qualities. Chinese sailors used crude forms of magnetic compasses as early as the
second century for navigation purposes.
It was not until the early 1800s that the relationship between electricity and magnetism was discovered. A Danish physicist, Hans
Christian Oersted, found that a compass placed near a conductor carrying an electrical current would swing away from north and point
toward the conductor. Later, it was discovered that a current-carrying
conductor wound around an iron rod would create a magnetic field
and magnetize the rod. You can make a simple magnet by winding an
insulated wire around an iron nail and connecting the two ends of the
insulated wire to a battery. Figure 4.12 illustrates this simple experiment. The compass is used to detect the presence of a magnetic field.
Prior to connecting the battery to the coil, the compass will point
toward the magnetic north pole of the earth. When the battery is connected to the circuit, the compass needle will swing from the magnetic
north to the direction of the nail magnet.

Magnetic fields exhibit unique forces of
attraction and repulsion. For convenience
of notation, the two ends of a magnet are
designated north and south poles. All
magnets possess a north and a south pole.
Magnetic lines of force emerge from the
north pole and travel back to the south
pole of the magnet. Figure 4.13 illustrates
the distribution of magnetic lines of force
surrounding a bar magnet. The magnetic
field intensity is greatest at each end of the
magnet. The total number of magnetic

FIGURE 4.13

the two magnets will be attracted to each
other. However, if two like poles (north-north or south-south) of two
magnets are placed close together, there is a repelling force and the
two magnets will attempt to move away from each other. This action is
known as the law of magnetic poles and can be stated as follows: Like
poles repel; unlike poles attract.
Although magnetic behavior of attraction and repulsion is similar to
that of electrically charged particles, there is one fundamental difference.
The electrically charged particle will possess either a negative or positive
charge over its entire surface. A magnet, on the other hand, will always
possess a north pole at one end and a south pole at the other end. These
twin poles can never be separated as individual entities.

Temporary and permanent magnets
Soft iron, such as the nail in Fig. 4.12, will retain magnetism as long as
the current flows through the wire. When the current is turned off, the
nail will lose most of its magnetism. This type of magnet is called a
temporary magnet. The remaining magnetism left in the nail is
referred to as residual magnetism.
When hard iron or steel is placed in a magnetic field, it will retain
most of the magnetic property after the magnetic field is removed.
When these types of materials are magnetized, they are referred to as
permanent magnets. Most speakers in amateur receivers contain a
powerful permanent magnet placed next to the voice coil. These
speakers are designated as permanent-magnet, or pm, speakers.

Electromagnetism
A magnetic field is generated around a conductor when an electrical
current flows through the conductor. The intensity of the magnetic

field is directly related to the amplitude of the current; any increase in
current results in a comparable increase in the magnetic field. Figure
4.14 illustrates this action.
If the conductor is wound in the form of a coil, as shown in Fig.
4.15, the strength or intensity of the magnetic field is increased many
times. The magnetic lines of force associated with each turn of the
conductor combine in the same direction with the magnetic lines of
force from the other turns. Thus, more lines of magnetic force will be
concentrated in a small space, all passing through the center of the
coil.
A coil designed to create a magnetic field for exerting physical
force or performing work in an electrical circuit is called an electromagnet. Electric motors, relays, solenoids, and headphones are some
of the devices that use electromagnets for performing work functions.

The amount of magnetic force or strength

number of turns, and the type of core
material used in the coil. The first two factors, current in amperes and number of
turns of the conductor, can be expressed in
ampere-turns. This represents the magnetomotive force or magnetic potential, similar to the concept of electromotive force

When a conductor is moved through a
magnetic field, cutting against the lines of
magnetic force, a voltage will be induced
in the conductor. Figure 4.16 shows the
effect of moving a conductor through a
magnetic field. This principle of electromagnetic induction is the basis for the
operation of electric generators, transformers, and even radio antennas.

At the beginning of this chapter the concepts of direct current (dc)
were used to demonstrate the relationships of voltage, current, and
resistance. These same concepts can be used to look at the principles
of alternating current (ac).
When the direction of current flow is reversed at periodic intervals,
the resulting varying current is known as alternating current. The voltage
producing an alternating current is, by definition, an alternating voltage
that continuously varies in amplitude and periodically reverses its polarity. An ac generator is a source of alternating voltage.

The ac sine wave
Almost all ac waveforms encountered in radio communications, as well
as the familiar 120-Vac, 60-Hz power in our homes, are sine waves. Let’s
take a look at the 60-Hz power and define some basics of ac waveforms.
These basics are also applicable at audio and radio frequencies.
Figure 4.17 shows two complete cycles of the standard 120-Vac, 60Hz voltage waveform. We call this a 60-Hz voltage because the frequency is 60 hertz, or 60 complete cycles per second.
The period of time for each cycle is directly related to the frequency
by the following equation:

where
f is the frequency in Hz
T is the period of each cycle in seconds
Thus, the period or the duration of each ac cycle of the 120-Vac, 60Hz voltage is 1⁄60, or 0.0167 seconds (16.67 milliseconds).
We are familiar with the expression 120 Vac power. However, Fig.
4.17 shows that the maximum values of voltage range from a positive
170 volts to a negative 170 volts during each ac cycle. This results in a
peak-to-peak voltage of 340 Vac.
The ac voltage and current values are often expressed in rms terms.
The expression rms is an abbreviation for “root mean square,” a mathematical expression for describing the effective value of an ac waveform. In practical terms, a 120-Vac, 60-Hz source provides the same
amount of power that a 120-Vdc source would provide. This is a convenient way to measure ac power. For example, a 120-volt light bulb
will glow with an equal brilliance when connected to either a 120-Vac
or 120-Vdc source.

The relationship between peak ac voltage and rms voltage for a sine

ac and rms current values.

Each ac sine wave is divided into 360 electrical degrees. This
helps us to designate the phase relationships of two or more ac waveforms which are not in phase with each other. Figure 4.18 shows voltage and current waveforms with both in-phase and out-of-phase
relationships.

ac circuits
The analyses of ac circuits are more complex when compared to dc circuits. Some
of the unusual characteristics of ac circuits
that have no equal in dc circuits are:
■ Opposition to ac current flow in an ac

circuit is not limited to resistance.
The total opposition to ac current
flow is known as impedance, which
includes resistance. Impedance also
includes capacitive reactance (ac
opposition developed by a capacitor)
and inductive reactance (ac opposition developed by an inductor). Like
resistance, impedance, capacitive
reactance, and inductive reactance
are measured in units of ohms. The
symbols used for impedance, capacitive reactance, and inductive reactance are Z, XC, and XL, respectively.

112 CHAPTER FOUR
■ ac current will flow through a capacitor, but a capacitor will

block the flow of dc current. As the frequency of the ac current
is increased, the capacitive reactance in ohms will decrease. At
high frequencies, a capacitor can act as a short circuit for all
practical purposes.
■ An inductor or coil possesses both inductance and dc resis-

tance. The inductance produces an inductive reactance that
increases as the frequency of operation is increased. In a dc circuit, only the dc resistance of the coil offers opposition to the
flow of current. However, in an ac circuit both inductive reactance and dc resistance offer opposition to the flow of current.
As the frequency is increased, the ac opposition will increase
until finally the inductor acts as an open circuit. For all practical purposes, this reduces the ac current flow to zero.
■ In an ac circuit, energy can be transferred from one circuit to

another by the electromagnetic induction action of transformers
with no physical connection between the circuits. Also, transformers can be used to step-up or step-down ac voltages or currents. In dc circuits, there are no equivalent transfer
characteristics.
■ In an ac circuit, the phase relationship between voltage and cur-

rent may vary such that the voltage may lead or lag the current
by a given phase angle usually expressed in electrical degrees.
There is no similar parallel in dc circuits—the voltage is always
in phase with the current.

Capacitors and Capacitance
Capacitors, originally called condensers, are used in almost every electronic circuit. A typical amateur transceiver will have almost as many
capacitors as resistors, which are probably the most widely used components. Capacitors are available in a wide variety of sizes, capacitances,
and working-voltage ratings. They can be divided into two broad categories—fixed and variable. Capacitors perform many functions, which
include:
■ Coupling, transferring, and bypassing ac current.

Ch04_Laster_136187-1

12:48 PM

Page 113

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGENTISM
■ Blocking dc voltages and currents.
■ Storing electrical energy and subsequent discharge of the charge

stored in the capacitor.
■ Tuning frequency-sensitive circuits.

Figure 4.19 shows a collection of typical capacitors used in amateur radio equipment.
The capacitors shown on the left are variable capacitors, used for
tuning radio-frequency circuits. Fixed coupling and bypass capacitors
are shown in the center. These include paper, mylar, ceramic, and
mica types. On the right are electrolytic capacitors, commonly used as
filter capacitors in power supplies and related applications. The bottom-right capacitor is a low-voltage tantalum capacitor available in the
range of about 0.1 to 100 microfarads.
We can define capacitance as the ability to store an electrical charge
in a dielectric or insulating material. A simple capacitor, shown in Fig.
4.20, consists of two metal plates separated by a dielectric material
such as air, glass, mica, or ceramic. The amount of capacitance developed by such a capacitor is related to the surface area of the plates, the

separation of the plates, and the dielectric
constant of the dielectric material.
Capacitance is measured in units of
farads (F). Because the farad is usually too
large for most electronic applications, you
will find the farad microfarads and
micromicrofarads (or picofarads).

How capacitors work
In performing its function in a circuit, a capacitor is charged and discharged sometimes as fast as millions to billions of times per second.
A simple way to illustrate the action of a capacitor is to connect it
across a battery as shown in Fig. 4.21A. The positive pole of the battery
attracts the free electrons in the upper plate of the capacitor, leaving a
net positive charge on this upper plate. At the same time, the negative
pole of the battery repels the free electrons in the lower conductor,
forcing them toward the lower plate of the capacitor. This results in a

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGENTISM

net negative charge on the lower plate. This current flow continues
until the voltage across the capacitor plates is equal to the battery voltage, 6 volts in this case. The capacitor is then fully charged.
The positive and negative charges on the capacitor plates create an
electric field between the two plates. This field distorts the molecular
structure of the dielectric material, producing an electrical stress. In
this manner an electric charge is stored in the dielectric.
The charged capacitor can now be disconnected from the battery,
retaining an electrical charge that can perform work (Fig. 4.21B). If the
capacitor is connected to a load such as a resistor as shown in Fig.
4.21C, the charge within the capacitor causes a current to flow until
the electrical energy is dissipated in the resistor in the form of heat. At
this point, the voltage across the capacitor drops to zero and the capacitor is discharged.

Capacitor voltage ratings
If the battery voltage in Fig. 4.21 is raised above the specified working
voltage of the capacitor, the dielectric material will break down and
conduct a heavy current. This action will damage or destroy many
types of capacitors. The working voltage, usually specified by the manufacturer, is defined as the maximum amount of voltage that can be
placed across the capacitor for safe, sustained operation. This voltage
rating is usually expressed in terms of dc voltage (Vdc) levels. The
working voltage ratings of capacitors can range from as low as 3 Vdc to
thousands of volts dc.
If an ac voltage is to be placed across a capacitor, the peak value of
the ac voltage must be used in selecting a capacitor with an adequate

Connecting capacitors in parallel
If two or more capacitors are connected in parallel, as shown in Fig.
4.22, the total capacitance is equal to the sum of the individual capacitors. This relationship is expressed as follows:

electronic capacitors are connected in circuits with dc potentials, the + terminal of the
capacitor must be connected to the positive terminal of the circuit. Otherwise, the electrolytic capacitor might be damaged by the dc potential.

Connecting capacitors in series
The total capacitance of two or more capacitors connected in series is
always less than the value of the smallest capacitor. One way to
remember how to compute the value of series capacitors is that it is the
same method used to compute resistors in parallel.
Three equations are available for computing the net capacitance of
capacitors connected in series. Figure 4.23 shows typical series capacitor circuits.

Capacitive reactance
The alternating charge and discharge action of a capacitor allows an ac
current to flow in a circuit. However, a capacitor, like a resistor, offers
opposition to the flow of the ac current. This opposition, or capacitive
reactance, depends upon the value of capacitance and the frequency of

Testing capacitors
Any capacitor can be quickly tested with a multimeter (set to measure
resistance) to determine if it is shorted or leaky. With the exception of
electrolytic capacitors, the resistance of virtually all other types
should be infinite in value. For example, capacitors with air, mica,
glass, ceramic, and similar dielectric materials should indicate an
open circuit (infinite resistance) when tested with an ohmmeter.
CAUTION: Don’t try to test the capacitor when it is soldered in a
“live” or powered-up circuit. Turn off all power to the circuit being
tested by unplugging the ac power cord! Otherwise, you might
experience a severe or fatal electrical shock. In many cases, you might
also damage the multimeter or the circuit being tested. Damage to the
multimeter can range from virtual destruction to requiring
replacement of an internal fuse within the instrument.

When you try to test a capacitor that is soldered in a circuit, adjacent resistors or other components connected in this circuit might
show resistance on your multimeter, falsely indicating a defective
capacitor. Unsolder one end of the capacitor before you test for a short
or leaky condition. Any observable resistance reading for these types
of capacitors indicates a defective component.

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGENTISM

Unfortunately, the above continuity test will not indicate a defective
capacitor with an open circuit. Further tests with a capacitor tester are
required to ensure that the capacitor has the required capacitance. Some
digital multimeters, including the portable handheld types, also have a
capacitance test capability. Before buying any multimeter for your ham
shack, you might want to consider one with this expanded test capability.
Many electrolytic capacitors, ranging from about 1 microfarad to
many thousands of microfarads, will show some leakage resistance
and still perform satisfactorily in a circuit. With a little experience,
you will be able to check almost any type of capacitor with a multimeter. In most cases, the capacitor must be removed from the circuit for
the test to be meaningful.

Inductors and Inductance
A simple inductor can be described as a coil with one or more turns of
wire, wound around a material known as the core. Some inductors
employ air as the core material. Like capacitors, inductors are used
primarily in ac circuits. Inductors perform many important functions
in electronic circuits such as transferring ac energy from one circuit to
another and as frequency selective elements in RF circuits.
Although many types and sizes of inductors are available from
commercial sources, they are not used as often as resistors and capacitors. Most inductors are manufactured for specific applications
involving a given frequency or band of frequencies. In some instances,
you might have to build a coil required for a specific application. However, coil forms and wire are available for most of these “home-brew”
coils. Figure 4.25 shows a collection of inductors found in ham radio
and other electronic equipment. The coils shown on the left are RF
chokes. At the top center are two torroid inductors, one molded in
plastic and the other a “home-brew” torroid for a project. The coils
shown at the bottom are adjustable inductors with powdered-iron
cores. An adjustable IF transformer, shown in the upper right, is used
in 455-kHz IF amplifier circuits.

Inductance
Inductance is the ability of a conductor to develop an induced voltage
when a varying or alternating current flows through the conductor.

Page 120

120 CHAPTER FOUR

FIGURE 4.25
Typical inductors used in amateur radio and other electronic equipment.

This induced voltage is produced by the expanding and contracting
magnetic field associated with the varying current.
When the conductor is wound in the form of a coil, the inductance
is increased many times depending on the number of turns. The coiled
conductor concentrates the magnetic field in a smaller volume and the
expanding and contracting field cuts across each turn of wire, simultaneously generating a higher voltage.
The inductance of a coil can be increased many times by changing the
core material. For example, a powdered-iron or ferrite core will increase
the inductance of an air-core coil many times. These materials are used
in radio-frequency coils to achieve higher efficiency of operation.
The unit of inductance is the henry (H). One henry is defined as the
amount of inductance that allows one volt to be induced across a coil
when the current through the coil changes at a rate of one ampere per
second. Most coils used in audio- and radio-frequency circuits possess
values of inductance in the millihenry and microhenry range.
1 millihenry  1 mH  0.001 H  1 × 10–3 H
1 microhenry  1 H  0.000001 H  1 × 10–6 H

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGENTISM

121

A unique characteristic of inductances involves the action of the
transformer. If the magnetic field created by one coil cuts across
another coil, a voltage is induced in the second coil. In this manner,
we can transfer ac energy from one circuit or another without any
direct physical connection. Transformers are covered in more detail at
the end of this section.

Series inductors
When two or more inductors are connected in series, as in Fig. 4.26,
the total inductance is equal to the sum of the individual values of
inductances, or:
LT  L1

L2

L3

...

(Eq. 4.16)

where
LT is the total inductance of the series combination
L1, L2, L3, etc., are the values of the individual inductances
All values of inductances must be expressed in the same units of
henrys.
This equation is not valid if the inductors are placed close together,
resulting in a “transformer action.” Mutual inductance is developed
when the magnetic field from one coil cuts across another coil. In a
series-aiding connection, additional inductance will be produced by
this mutual inductance. On the other hand, if the coils are connected
in a series-opposing manner, the mutual inductance will have a canceling effect and the total inductance of the two coils will be less than
the sum of the individual values of inductance.

Parallel inductors
The equations for series and parallel
inductors are similar to those for series
and parallel resistor combinations.
Parallel combinations of inductors are
illustrated in Fig. 4.27. The equations used
to compute the total inductances are given
here. Remember, these equations are not
valid if mutual induction exists between
any of the coils.

Inductive reactance, X

L

Inductive reactance is the opposition to the flow of ac current developed by an inductance. It is due to the opposing induced voltage created by the expanding and contracting magnetic field. This
opposition, which does not include the dc resistance of the inductor,
is measured in ohms.
Inductive reactance varies directly with both inductance and the
operating frequency. An increase in either factor results in a corresponding increase in inductive reactance. This relationship is
expressed as:
XL = 2πfL or

(Eq. 4.20)

XL = 6.28fL

(Eq. 4.21)

where
XL is the inductive reactance in ohms
π is the constant pi (3.1416)
f is the frequency in Hz
L is the inductance in hertz

Phase angle of inductors
A varying or alternating current flow produces an induced voltage
across an inductor. In an ideal inductor (one with no dc resistance),
the current lags the induced voltage by 90 electrical degrees. This
means that the phase angle between the voltage and current is 90
degrees, as shown in Fig. 4.28.
This 90-degree phase angle is due to the fact that the induced voltage depends on the rate of change in the current flowing through the
inductor. For example, at 0, 180, and 360 degrees, the current is

changing at maximum rate while at 90 and 270 degrees, the rate of
current change approaches zero. We are not referring to actual values
of current, but to how fast the current is changing in value. The voltage levels at 0, 180, and 360 degrees are at a maximum because the
rate of current change is highest at these angles. However, the
induced voltage drops to zero at 90 and 270 degrees because the current is not changing in value at these angles.

Transformers
The transformer is an electromagnetic device for transforming or changing alternating voltage or current from one level to another. In its simplest form, a transformer consists of two inductors placed close together
so that a magnetic field generated in one inductor will cut across the
other inductor. This induces a voltage in the second inductor.
Transformers are used in radio and electronic equipment for many
applications. The ac power transformer shown in Fig. 4.29 can be used
in the power supply circuit of an amateur receiver to transform the
120-Vac commercial power to 24 Vac. The power transformer also performs another important function, that of isolating the 120-Vac power

line from the common ground connections of the receiver. This helps
to eliminate potential shock hazard to the amateur operator.
The same receiver might contain an audio output transformer to
drive the low-impedance speaker, or RF and IF transformers to couple
RF and IF signals between stages.

Basic transformer concepts
Transformers can be classified as one-to-one, step-up, or step-down,
depending on the ratio of the number of turns in the primary winding
to the number of turns in the secondary winding. A one-to-one transformer produces a voltage in the secondary winding equal to that
being applied to the primary winding. The step-up transformer produces a higher output voltage, when compared to the input voltage
applied to the primary winding.

The turns ratio determines the general operating characteristics of a
transformer: one-to-one, step-up, or step-down. The voltage ratio in
terms of turns ratio is:
VP

(Eq. 4.22)

where
VP is the voltage across the primary winding in volts

One interesting aspect of step-up or step-down transformers is that
the step-up transformer reduces the output current available while the
step-down transformer provides for an increase in current in the secondary winding.
Some transformers have more than one secondary winding. The
equations just given for finding output voltage and current levels must
be used for each secondary winding in relationship to the primary
winding.

Testing inductors and transformers with a multimeter
The multimeter can be used to check inductors and transformers for
open windings and, in some instances, shorted windings. For example, if the manufacturer’s specifications regarding the resistance of
windings are available, the multimeter, particularly the digital multimeter with precise readout of resistance, can be used to check these
resistance values. If the resistance readings indicated by the multimeter are lower than those specified by the manufacturer, one or more
turns of the winding are probably shorted.
CAUTION: Don’t try to test the inductor or transformer when it is

connected in a “live” or powered-up circuit. Turn off all power to the
circuit being tested by unplugging the ac power cord! Otherwise, you
might experience a severe or fatal electrical shock. In many cases, you
can also damage the multimeter or the circuit being tested. Damage to
the multimeter can range from virtual destruction to requiring
replacement of an internal fuse within the instrument.
Large audio inductors and power transformers will exhibit a resistance of a few ohms to 20 ohms or more. Small inductors used in RF
and IF applications will normally show a resistance of one ohm or

127

Ch04_Laster_136187-1

12:48 PM

Page 128

128 CHAPTER FOUR
less. The actual resistance will depend on the size of the wire and the
number of turns.
Any inductor or transformer that exhibits an abnormal resistance
reading or an open winding should be replaced with a new component
of equal specifications.

ac Circuit Analysis
Resistors, capacitors, and inductors all offer opposition to the flow of
current in an ac circuit. Although this opposition is always measured in
units of ohms, we find that each component behaves differently in the
circuit. The resistor merely impedes the flow of ac current and dissipates energy in the form of heat. The capacitor and the ideal inductor
offer opposition to ac current flow but do not consume energy. The
energy temporarily stored in each component—an electric field in the
capacitor and a magnetic field in the inductor—is returned to the circuit
during a portion of each cycle.
A complete study of ac circuit analysis is beyond the scope of this
book and the requirements for the Technician Class license. However,
we will review a few concepts that will help to explain the operation
of ac circuits in amateur radio transmitters and receivers.

Impedance and phase angles
Impedance is a measure of the total opposition that a component or circuit presents to an ac current (power, audio signal, or RF signal). Impedance can contain resistance, capacitive reactance, and inductive
reactance in series and/or parallel combinations.
Impedance must be considered when connecting ac circuits, components, or equipment together. For example, the impedance of an HF
antenna for 40 meters, the RF transmission line, and the RF output of
an amateur transmitter are all related. If the impedances of these
devices are not matched, RF power will be lost and the efficiency of
radio transmissions will be reduced. Impedances of other devices
such as microphones, audio amplifiers, and speakers must be considered when they are connected together as an audio system. In fact,
almost every circuit within a transmitter or receiver relies on the
proper matching of impedances for the required operational characteristics.

Ch04_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:48 PM

Page 129

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGENTISM

Any analysis of impedance must take into account the phase
angle of the component or circuit involved. Voltages (or currents) in
phase are additive in nature while those out of phase tend to cancel
each other.

Resonance and tuned circuits
The concept of resonance is one of the most important factors in radio
communications. Without resonant or tuned circuits, we would be
unable to separate the desired signal from the many signals intercepted by the antenna. The selectivity of the receiver’s RF and IF
amplifier stages, and the frequency-determining networks of the local
and beat-frequency oscillators, are all related to the phenomenon of
resonance.
The radio transmitter employs tuned circuits for generating, amplifying, and modulating RF signals. Tuned circuits allow the RF signals
to be coupled to the transmission line while attenuating harmonics or
other undesired signals generated within the transmitter. Finally, the
antenna acts as a tuned circuit, resonant only at the frequency of the
signal being transmitted.
The series LC network in Fig. 4.31A acts as a short circuit at the resonant frequency. This is due to the fact that the capacitive reactance is
equal but opposite to the inductive reactance. As a result, the reactances

cancel and the impedance of the network is zero ohms. However, above
and below the resonant frequency, the LC network exhibits inductive
and capacitive reactance, respectively. Series resonant networks are
sometimes used as wave traps in antenna circuits to bypass interfering
signals (of a different frequency) to ground. Figure 4.31B illustrates this
type of application.
Parallel resonant LC networks, such as shown in Fig. 4.32, exhibit
maximum impedance at the resonant frequency. Above or below the
resonant frequency, the network appears as a capacitive or inductive
reactance, respectively. When this type of network is connected across
the input of a tube or transistor amplifier, only the resonant-frequency
signals are allowed to be amplified. Signals above or below the resonant frequency are shunted to ground.
The resonant frequency for either the series or parallel LC network
can be computed by the following equation:

PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGENTISM

The Q of resonant circuits
The Q of a series or parallel resonant circuit is defined as the figure
of merit or quality factor for that particular circuit. In general, the Q
of a circuit describes the selectivity or sharpness of the response
curve for a resonant circuit. A high Q means that the circuit has a
narrow selectivity with a corresponding low bandwidth factor. The
bandwidth of the parallel LC network in Fig. 4.32 is indicated by the
frequencies f1 and f2. Actually, the bandwidth for this circuit is equal
to f2 – f1. Frequencies f1 and f2 are the points where the response of the
parallel LC network drops to 0.707 of the maximum response at the
resonant frequency, fr.
The Q of an inductor is equal to the ratio of the inductive reactance
to the effective resistance of the coil. For example, a coil wound with
a large size of wire would exhibit very little dc resistance. Accordingly, the Q of this coil would be much higher than a similar coil constructed with smaller size wire. A smaller dc resistance in the coil
winding means that the coil will dissipate less energy as heat.
The capacitor also can be described in terms of its Q. This is essentially a ratio of the energy stored in the capacitor to the energy dissipated as heat due to the effective resistance of the capacitor dielectric
losses. In most capacitors, the effective resistance values are in the
hundreds to thousands of megohms. Therefore, the capacitor will
exhibit an extremely high Q.

Power Relationships
The power associated with an electrical circuit, either ac or dc, is
defined as the rate at which work is being performed. For example, a
current flowing in a resistor performs work in the sense that electrical
current is being converted to heat. A radio transmitter performs work
by generating RF energy that can be fed into an antenna, thereby creating electromagnetic waves.
The basic unit of electrical power is the watt. In radio communications, power is often expressed in terms of:
1 microwatt  1 µW  0.000001 watt  1 × 10–6 watt
1 milliwatt  1 mW  0.001 watt  1 × 10–3 watt

1 kilowatt  1 kW  1000 watts  1 × 103 watts
1 megawatt  1 MW  1,000,000 watts  1 × 106 watts
Electrical power can be converted to mechanical power. An electric
motor, for example, converts electricity into a rotating mechanical
motion. Mechanical power is expressed in units of horsepower. The
relationship between horsepower and the watt is:
1 horsepower  746 watts

Power in a dc circuit
The power delivered to a resistive load by a direct-current source is
determined by the voltage across the load times the current through
the resistive load, or:
P  VI

(Eq. 4.27)

where
P is the power in watts
V is the voltage in volts across the load
I is the current in amperes through the load

Power in an ac circuit
Calculations involving power delivered to an ac circuit are more complex than dc power calculations. The resistive elements in an ac circuit dissipate power in the form of heat. This is known as the real
power delivered to the ac circuit. This power is usually computed
using Equation 4-29, above.

ubes and semiconductor devices form the basis for all electronic circuits involving rectification, amplification, oscillation, digital, and
other related functions. Tubes (such as triodes and pentodes) and transistors are called active devices because they are amplifying devices
capable of boosting very weak signals to high-level amplitudes. For
example, audio amplifiers can be used to amplify low-level audio signals from microphones or phonograph pick-up devices, to high signal
levels capable of driving loudspeakers. Radio frequency amplifiers (RF
amplifiers) are used in radio receivers to amplify extremely weak RF signals (in the microvolt range) from an antenna for subsequent signal processing and ultimate conversion to audio signals for driving speakers or
headphones.
The vacuum tube, once the mighty workhorse in radio communications, has been relegated to the back seat by the smaller, more efficient
transistor. Most all new radio equipment on today’s market employs
solid-state technology. Only a few specialized applications, such as
high-power final amplifiers in the range of 1000 watts and above still
continue to use vacuum tubes.
The triode vacuum tube was invented by Lee De Forest in 1906.
One of the most important inventions of the twentieth century, the
vacuum tube spurred the development of radio communications,

radar, television, space-age electronics, computers, and the list
goes on.
The present investment in vacuum tube electronic equipments,
particularly amateur radios, is enormous. For example, vacuum tube
HF transceivers will continue to give excellent service for years to
come. You can usually find some of these old, reliable ham radios at
local swap-fests and amateur radio conventions. Also, many major
electronic companies continue to manufacture quality HF “1 kilowatt
final power amplifiers” using rugged power tubes. The FCC requires
that all amateur radio operators develop a working knowledge of vacuum tubes and includes questions about this subject on all amateur
examinations. Some introductory material on vacuum tubes is provided here to help you pass the FCC examinations as well as to set up
and operate vacuum tube ham radios. Also, from time to time, you will
find some interesting construction articles involving home-built vacuum tube transmitters and receivers in amateur radio magazines such
as CQ, QST, and 73.
Like the vacuum tube, the invention of the transistor in the late
1940s and the integrated circuit in the late 1950s produced a major
impact on all fields of electronics. Although the first semiconductor
devices (crystal detectors using silicon or carborundum) were
invented about 1906, scientists at that time could not explain the theory behind the crystal rectifier. The major breakthrough came in
1947 when scientists at the Bell Telephone Laboratories developed
the present-day semiconductor theory. This immediately led to the
fabrication of the transistor, the first solid-state amplifying device;
junction diodes; and thyristors. The disadvantages of the vacuum
tube—fragility, bulkiness, requiring high-voltage power supplies,
and use of filaments that require warm-up time and excessive
amounts of power—are eliminated by the rugged and compact transistor.
Let’s examine the tube and semiconductor devices in more detail.
You won’t need all this theory and practical information for the Technician Class examinations; only one question on vacuum tubes is
included in these examinations. However, a good background on tubes
and semiconductors will help you understand the operation of your
amateur radio equipment as well as prepare you for upgrade to higher
class amateur licenses.

TUBES AND SEMICONDUCTORS

Definitions
Semiconductor A class of materials that are neither good conductors nor good insulators of electricity. These materials, such as germanium and silicon, possess relatively few free electrons for conducting
electrical current. In their pure form, semiconductors have little use in
electronic applications.
PN junction diode The pn junction diode, a two-terminal semiconductor device, is the simplest form of semiconductor used in electronics. This device consists of two tiny blocks of semiconductor
material referred to as n-type and p-type. These two blocks are, in
effect, joined together as one continuous block with leads connected to
each end. The pn junction diode allows current to flow easily in one
direction but literally blocks current flow in the opposite direction.
The two leads or terminals of the pn junction diode are referred to as
the anode and cathode. A pn junction diode can be constructed from
either germanium or silicon. PN junction diodes are used as rectifiers
in power supplies, detectors in radio receivers, and in other applications where rectification action is required.
Zener diode The zener diode, a two-terminal device, uses the
reverse-voltage characteristics of a pn junction to cause a voltage
breakdown that results in a high current through the diode. This
action produces a constant voltage drop across the diode and exhibits
voltage-regulating characteristics. Zener diodes are extremely useful
as voltage regulators in power supplies.
Bipolar transistor The bipolar transistor consists of three layers of
n-type and p-type semiconductor material arranged either in a npn or
pnp configuration. The three leads from the npn or pnp transistor are
called the emitter, base, and collector. The bipolar transistor is a current-amplifying device and is used in amplifier, oscillator, and other
types of electronic circuits.
Field-effect transistor Field-effect transistors, or FETs, are constructed from various layers of n-type and p-type semiconductor materials. FETs are available in two general types: the junction, field-effect
transistor (JFET), and the insulated-gate field-effect transistor (IGFET).
Sometimes the IGFET is referred to as a metal-oxide semiconductor
field-effect transistor, or MOSFET. The FET transistor is a voltageamplifying device, and as such possesses a very high input resistance.

137

12:49 PM

Page 138

138 CHAPTER FIVE
FETs are useful in amplifier, oscillator, and other types of electronic
circuits where an active device is required.
Vacuum tube The vacuum or electron tube is a device that consists of a number of electrodes mounted in an evacuated enclosure of
glass or metal. The vacuum tube employs a controlled flow of electron
current to perform functions such as rectification or amplification.
A vacuum tube can contain one or more of the following electrodes
or elements:
■ Cathode The cathode produces a stream of electrons that are

directed towards the anode electrode. In most tubes, the cathode
is heated indirectly, resulting in thermionic emission of electrons.
■ Anode The anode, or plate, is the electrode to which the stream

of electrons flow.
■ Grid A grid is an electrode normally placed between the cath-

ode and plate to control the flow of electrons. The grid has one or
more openings to permit passage of the electrons. A vacuum tube
can use one or more grids for controlling the flow of electrons.
The grids are called control, screen, suppressor or space-charge,
depending on the function to be performed.
Diode The diode is the simplest form of a vacuum tube and consists of two electrodes, a cathode and plate. The word diode is
derived from di, meaning two, and ode, for electrode. A positive
potential, or voltage applied to the plate electrode, will attract the
electrons emitted from the cathode. This results in one-way flow of
current through the diode tube. Diodes are used primarily to rectify
ac signals.
Triode A major step in vacuum tube development, the triode provides a capability to amplify weak audio and radio-frequency signals.
The triode is a three-electrode device having a control grid positioned
between the cathode and plate. The grid controls the flow of electrons
to the plate. In addition to amplification, we can use the triode for
other important functions in electronic circuits, such as frequency
generation, conversion, modulation, and demodulation.
Pentode The pentode, a five-element vacuum tube, can be described
as the ideal amplifier in vacuum tube development. Scientists had

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:49 PM

Page 139

TUBES AND SEMICONDUCTORS

invented the tetrode, a four-element vacuum tube to overcome the limitations of the triode. Although an improvement over the triode, the
tetrode still possessed limitations. The pentode, possessing a cathode,
control grid, screen grid, suppressor grid, and plate provides higher signal amplification and more stable operating characteristics.

Vacuum Tubes
Some typical vacuum tubes used in amateur radio and other electronic
equipment are illustrated in Fig. 5.1. The tube on the left is a heavy-duty
full-wave rectifier used in power supplies. The next two tubes are transmitting power tubes and are rated at 35 and 15 watts, respectively. The
three tubes on the right are used in receiving or low-power applications
and are referred to as 9-pin miniature, subminiature, and nuvistor types,
respectively. (The nuvistor is the small metal tube below the miniature
tube.)

Thermionic Emission
Thermionic emission is produced when energy such as heat is applied
to a metallic material. For example, if we cause a sufficiently high
electrical current to flow through a wire, the heat produced in the wire
will cause a cloud of free electrons to be emitted from the surface of
the wire.
Thermionic emission is caused by the acceleration of electrons
within a material due to increased energy. When the energy imparted
to the electrons reaches a given level, the electrons will break away

from the surface of the material, forming a cloud of free electrons.
Unless influenced by an external force, such as an electric field, the
free electrons will be attracted back to the surface of the material while
other electrons are being emitted into the cloud. For a given material
and a given temperature, the number of free electrons contained in the
cloud will remain relatively constant.
As shown in Fig. 5.2A, the cathode within a vacuum tube produces a cloud of free electrons by either direct or indirect heating
methods. Once produced, the cloud of free electrons can be made to
flow in a specified direction to other electrodes within the tube, performing functions such as rectification and amplification. Each particular type of vacuum tube requires a specific heater voltage and
current. Heater voltage values range from about 1.4 volts for batteryoperated equipment and 6.3 volts to 117 volts for ac-operated equipments. Current requirements range from tens to hundreds of
milliamperes for receiving tubes to several amperes for high-power
transmitting tubes. A vacuum tube handbook or The ARRL Handbook will provide specific information on the voltage and current
requirements for each tube’s heater, as well as other tube operating
characteristics. Either ac or dc voltage can be used to power the

heater in most vacuum tubes—the indirectly heated cathode using
mostly ac power, and directly heated cathode using either ac or dc
power.

General Types of Vacuum Tubes
Many types of vacuum tubes have been developed over the past sixty
years. Specific types used in amateur radio equipment include the
diode, triode, tetrode, pentode, and cathode ray tube or CRT. Table 5.1
provides a summary of these tubes, their applications and commonly
used symbols.

Diodes
The diode is a simple two-electrode tube containing a cathode and
plate. The heater cathode emits a cloud of free electrons that possess
negative charges. If the plate voltage of the diode is made positive
with respect to the cathode, the free electrons are attracted to the
plate, resulting in a flow of electrical current. Figure 5.3A provides a
test circuit that illustrates the action of a diode in a dc circuit. An
analysis of this circuit, as well as the following ac rectification circuit,
will provide you with an insight into the theory of the diode tube as
well as troubleshooting techniques.
The 6AL5 used in this test circuit is a twin diode installed in a 7pin miniature glass envelope. Only one of the diode sections (Pins 1
and 7) is used in this circuit. Figure 5.3B shows the basing diagram for
the electrical connections within the tube. Basing diagrams are usually
referenced from the bottom view of the tube.
Each diode section in the 6AL5 can be used independently of the
other; there are no electrical connections between the two sections.
Many multipurpose tubes contain two or more independent sections
such as diode-triode, triode-triode, or triode-pentode. The 6AL5 has a
common heater for the two diodes, which requires 6.3 volts (ac or dc) at
0.3 ampere. Note that the 6AL5 in Fig. 5.3A is connected to a 6-volt battery. There is no electrical connection between the heater and cathodes.
If we set switch S1 to position A, the potential on the plate electrode is zero volts. As a result, none of the electrons being emitted by
the cathode will be attracted to the plate. To verify that no current is

flowing in the plate circuit, you can measure the voltage across the
load resistor R1 with a dc voltmeter. A zero voltage indicates no voltage drop; thus, no current through the resistor.
When we move switch S1 to position B, a positive voltage potential
is placed on the plate and free electrons will flow to the plate. The
quantity of electrons contained in this flow to the plate depends on
several factors, including the number of electrons being emitted from
the cathode and the amplitude of the positive potential placed on the

plate. Again, we can use a dc voltmeter to check for the presence of
current and also the magnitude of this current. Connect the voltmeter
across resistor R1 and determine the voltage value. Using Ohm’s law,
we can find the actual plate current (amperes) by dividing the plate
voltage (volts) by the resistance (ohms) of R1. An alternate method for
finding the plate current is to break the circuit at the plate terminal
and connect a dc ammeter. However, you have to physically break the
conductor to use the ammeter method.
Moving switch S1 to position C results in making the plate negative
with respect to the cathode. This negative potential repels the negatively charged electrons, prohibiting any current flow within the
diode.

The diode as an ac rectifier
The great utility of the diode is its ability to conduct current in only one
direction. Thus we can use a diode to change ac current into dc current.
This process is known as rectification. Figure 5.4 illustrates how a diode
rectifies an ac current. The waveform for the ac input signal is shown at
the top of Fig. 5.4B. This signal varies from +5 volts peak to –5 volts peak
amplitude. Because the diode conducts in only one direction, only the
positive portion of the ac waveform is conducted by the diode. As a

result, a positive voltage is developed across load resistor R1. The waveform of the rectified signal is shown at the bottom of Fig. 5.4B. In practical circuits, the frequency of the ac signal can vary from power-line
frequencies of 60 Hz to radio frequencies in the hundreds of MHz.
In some circuits, diodes are used to demodulate signals at RF or IF frequencies. Demodulation is a form of rectification where the modulating
signal, such as voice or tones, is separated from the carrier frequency.

Triodes
The triode, a three-electrode tube, has a control grid positioned between
the cathode and the plate. The purpose of this control grid is to control
the flow of electrons from the cathode to the plate. The addition of the
control grid to the vacuum tube greatly enhanced the capabilities of the
tube and revolutionized the electronics field. For the first time, signals,
such as audio and RF could be amplified. Electronic oscillators, modulators, and other specialized circuits made possible the design and fabrication of sensitive radio receivers, stable high-power transmitters, and a
host of other equipment.
The control grid, sometimes simply referred to as the grid, usually
consists of a fine wire that is wound on insulated supports and sur-

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

12:49 PM

TUBES AND SEMICONDUCTORS

rounds the cathode. This wire can be wound in the form of a helix or
a ladder type of construction. The spacing between the wire is large
compared to the size of the wire. This allows most of the electrons
from the cathode to flow unobstructed to the plate.
Dimensions, shapes, and spacing of the three electrodes used in triodes vary in relation to the intended applications. In some instances,
two or three triodes are installed inside of one envelope with independent operation of each triode section. Figure 5.5A illustrates the
basic construction used in triodes. The physical supports for the electrodes are not shown. Triodes, like diodes, can have either directly or
indirectly heated cathodes. Figure 5.5B shows the symbols for typical
triode tubes.

How triodes work
The operation of a triode is based primarily on the polarity and magnitude of the voltage impressed on the control grid. A positive voltage
potential on the grid attracts the negatively charged free electrons,
causing more of them to be accelerated towards the plate electrode.

146 CHAPTER FIVE
The result is an increased current flow through the tube’s plate circuit.
Alternately, a negative voltage potential on the grid repels the free
electrons, causing many of them to be returned to the cathode’s surface. Thus the resulting current flow from cathode to plate is reduced
or even cut off entirely.
This grid voltage can be either ac or dc. dc voltages are used for our
description of the operation of this tube. Figure 5.6 illustrates three conditions for a triode. You can use a dc voltmeter to verify these operating
conditions. dc voltage readings showing grid-to-ground and plate-toground voltage differences can help you troubleshoot defective tube circuits in your receiver or transmitter. Again, be extremely careful in
making such measurements; you can experience severe or fatal electrical
shock. Also, you might destroy your dc voltmeter if it is not switched to
the proper function and voltage range.
With no voltage applied to the grid, the triode acts like a diode. The
current flow between the cathode and plate depends on the polarity

and amplitude of the plate voltage. Because the grid is now at a zero
voltage potential, it has virtually no effect on the negatively charged
electrons being emitted by the cathode.
When a negative voltage is applied to the grid, a negative electrostatic field is created between the grid and cathode. This negative field
opposes or repels the electrons being emitted by the cathode. As a
result, fewer electrons are able to pass through the grid and reach the
plate.
As the negative potential of the grid is increased, the plate current
is eventually reduced to zero. This condition is known as cutoff, and
the amplitude of the grid voltage necessary to cause this state is
referred to as the cutoff voltage.
A positive grid voltage causes an increase in plate current. This is due
to the positive electrostatic field around the grid that attracts the electrons
and accelerates them toward the plate. If the positive voltage on the grid
is increased beyond a given amplitude, all electrons being emitted by the
cathode will flow to the plate. No further increase in plate current is possible. This condition is known as saturation. In normal receiving-tube
applications, saturation does not exist because the grid voltage is not driven to excessive positive levels. Most triode tube circuits use a bias or
fixed dc grid voltage to establish a plate current level between the tube’s
cut-off and saturation levels.
The circuits in Fig. 5.6 do not show the filament or heater power
supplies that heat the cathode. All subsequent symbols for vacuum
tubes will assume that the filaments or heaters are connected to a
power source unless it is pertinent to show these connections. You will
find most diagrams of radio and electronic equipment do not show the
filament or heater connections with the tube symbols. All of the filament or heater connections are normally given in a separate section of
the schematic diagram that is associated with the power supply.

Triode amplification action
The great utility of the triode is that it provides an amplification
action. A small change of grid voltage, representing an input signal,
produces a much larger change of voltage in the output plate circuit.
Thus, the triode serves primarily as a voltage amplifier. Figure 5.7 shows
a simplified triode circuit that can be used as an audio amplifier for
speech or music applications. This circuit uses a fixed bias supply of –4

volts and a plate supply voltage of +250 volts. Capacitors C1 and C2 isolate the signal input and output connections from the tube’s dc voltages.
Using an oscilloscope to measure the input and output peak-to-peak signal levels, we can determine the voltage gain of this or other similar
amplifiers. The voltage gain or amplification for this circuit is 40/4, or
10. Called a common-cathode configuration, this amplifier inverts the
output signal. That is, the output is 180 degrees out of phase with the
input signal.

Limitations of triodes
The main limitation of the triode tube is that of interelectrode capacitance, especially the capacitance between the control grid and the
plate. When we use the triode as an amplifier in circuits where the
frequency of operation is high, the grid plate capacitance provides a
feedback path. This feedback effect results in unstable operation
and may cause the amplifier to oscillate. At audio frequencies, the
grid-plate capacitance is negligible and, in most cases, this limitation can be ignored. However, at intermediate frequencies (IF) and
radio frequencies (RF), the grid-plate capacitance of a triode must be
considered in any design of amplifier circuits. For example, neutral-

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

12:49 PM

Page 149

TUBES AND SEMICONDUCTORS

izing capacitors are employed with high-power transmitting triodes
to balance out the effects of the interelectrode capacitances. Triodes
are seldom used as IF or RF amplifiers.
Another major limitation of the triode is that it does not satisfy all
the amplifying or gain requirements needed in receivers, transmitters,
and other electronic equipment. For example, signal levels in the highfrequency spectrum might be on the order of a few microvolts at the
antenna terminals. Triode amplifiers typically provide a gain of 5 to
20. Thus, many triodes would be required to amplify these signals to
sufficient level for driving headphones or loudspeakers.

Tetrodes and Pentodes
Limitations of triodes led to the development of tetrodes, pentodes,
and related types of vacuum tubes. These tubes have very little gridplate interelectrode capacitance and they possess high gain characteristics. Tetrode and pentode symbols are given in Fig. 5.8.

The tetrode
The grid-plate interelectrode capacitance of the triode can be reduced
to an insignificant value by adding a fourth electrode, called the screen
grid, between the grid and plate. Having four electrodes, this tube is
designated as a tetrode. The screen grid, like the control grid, does not
materially interfere with the flow of electrons from the cathode to the

plate because of the wide spacing of the screen-grid wires. Figure 5.9
shows a basic tetrode amplifier circuit.
Unlike the control grid, the screen grid is operated at a high positive potential. This screen-grid voltage, normally lower than the plate
voltage, produces another desirable advantage over the triode. The
plate current is independent of plate voltage because the screen grid
supplies a positive potential that pulls the electrons from the cathode
to the plate. As long as the plate voltage is higher than the screen voltage, the plate current in the tube depends primarily on the screen-grid
voltage and very little on the plate voltage. This action of the tetrode
results in a higher amplification factor and increases plate resistance
as compared to the triode.

Limitations of the tetrode
Although the tetrode is a considerable improvement over the triode,
secondary emission limits the performance of this tube. Secondary
emission of electrons occurs when high-velocity electrons from the
cathode strike the metallic plate surface. During this process, several
secondary electrons might be knocked free from the plate by each
high-velocity electron striking the plate. As long as the plate is more
positive than the screen grid, these secondary electrons will be
attracted back to the plate. However, if the plate voltage drops below
the screen voltage due to a high input signal, the secondary electrons
will be attracted to the screen grid. The net result is that the amplifi-

cation of the tube is decreased and the output signal is distorted.
Tetrodes are used primarily as power transmitting tubes in many
amateur transmitters. The 6146 and the 2E26 are representative of
medium-power tetrode transmitting tubes.

The pentode
The pentode, a five-electrode tube, has a suppressor grid placed
between the screen grid and plate electrode. In most pentodes, the
suppressor grid is internally connected to the cathode. Thus, the suppressor grid is essentially at a ground or slightly positive voltage
potential in most pentode circuits. Figure 5.10 shows a basic pentode
amplifier circuit.
The purpose of the suppressor grid is to eliminate the effects of secondary emission encountered in the tetrode. Because the suppressor
grid is at a negative potential with respect to the plate, it repels the secondary electrons and forces them back to the plate. The addition of the
suppressor grid further reduces the grid-plate interelectrode capacitance. Therefore, the pentode can provide higher amplification with
reduced feedback instability problems when compared to the tetrode.
Voltage gain or amplification for pentode amplifiers can range up to
200 or more for receiving pentodes, such as the 6AG5, 6AU6, and the
6CB6. Pentodes are used almost exclusively in tube-type amateur
receivers and transceivers for RF and IF amplifiers.

152 CHAPTER FIVE
The pentode as an amplifier
Figure 5.11 shows a 6AU6 pentode connected as a simple audio amplifier. This amplifier has a frequency response of approximately 100 Hz
to 10 kHz, which is more than adequate for the voice frequency spectrum. Resistance-capacitance (RC) coupling is used in the input grid
and output plate circuits for coupling the low-level signal into the
amplifier and amplified output signal to the next stage. RC coupling
isolates the low-grid and high-plate dc voltage levels from the input and
output circuitry.
Another important aspect of this circuit is that of self-bias. This
eliminates the need for a separate grid voltage power supply. The selfbias grid voltage is developed by the cathode resistor Rk, which develops a negative grid bias voltage. The voltage drop across the cathode
resistor due to the cathode current raises the cathode to a positive
potential with respect to the control grid. The cathode bypass capacitor Ck across the cathode resistor bypasses the cathode AF signals to
ground, leaving a dc voltage drop across the cathode resistor. Thus, the
dc voltage on the grid electrode with respect to the cathode electrode
has a negative voltage potential, providing a grid voltage for the tube

circuit. This eliminates the need to use a separate negative power supply for grid biasing.
The 6AU6 pentode amplifier develops a voltage gain of approximately 200. This means that a 50-millivolt input signal to the control
grid will be amplified to 200 times its original level. The output signal
across the plate load resistor will be 200 times 50 millivolts (200 ×
0.05), or 10 volts in amplitude.
Specific vacuum tube operating specifications and design data for
triodes, tetrodes, and pentodes are available in many vacuum-tube
manuals and electronic handbooks such as The ARRL Handbook. This
type of information is useful in servicing tube-type amateur equipment.

Beam-power tubes
The beam-power tube combines the advantages of the tetrode and pentode to provide for an increased power handling capability. This type
of tube has a cathode, control grid, screen grid, plate, and beam-forming electrodes that concentrate beams of electrons to the plate.
Although the exterior appearance of beam-power tubes are identical to
other tubes, the tube electrodes are larger to accommodate the additional power developed by these tubes. Typical beam-power tubes
used in present-day amateur receivers and transceivers include the
6AQ5, 6DS5, and the 6V6.

Gas-filled tubes
The thyratron, a gas-filled triode tube, and the cold-cathode voltageregulator tube are representative of special-purpose tubes that employ
a gaseous atmosphere within the envelope of the tube. These tubes
conduct current due to the ionization of the gaseous atmosphere
inside of the tube.
The thyratron initially conducts current only when the control grid is
made positive. However, after the tube begins to conduct current, the
grid no longer has an effect on the flow of current. The plate voltage must
be reduced below the ionization potential of the gas in order to cut off the
current flow. The thyratron is used primarily to control ac current.
Cold-cathode voltage-regulator tubes are used to maintain constant
voltage drops for dc power supply applications. Sometimes referred to
as VR tubes, these tubes are available in a number of voltage ratings,
such as 75, 90, 105, and 150 volts.

154 CHAPTER FIVE
Cathode-ray tubes
Cathode-ray tubes are used to provide a visual display of electrical signals such as a sine-wave display on an oscilloscope or a video signal
on a television receiver. The electron gun within a cathode-ray tube
produces a thin beam of high-speed electrons that is directed toward a
fluorescent screen. When the electrons strike the fluorescent screen,
visible light is produced. This stream of electrons can be deflected by
electrostatic plates or by a magnetic field to provide the required display of information. Figure 5.12 shows the two types of cathode-ray
tubes currently in use. High voltages on the order of 1000 to 15,000
volts are required to produce the stream of high-speed electrons.

Diodes, Transistors, and
other Semiconductor devices
Semiconductor diodes and transistors have replaced virtually all types
of vacuum tubes used in modern amateur radio equipment. These
semiconductor devices operate on unique principles not encountered
in conventional conductors of electrical current, such as copper wire
or vacuum tubes. In contrast, pure semiconductor materials—primarily germanium and silicon—possess relatively few free electrons available for conducting electrical current. The semiconductor material has
a crystaline atomic structure where virtually all of the electrons are
locked together in the outer orbit of each atom. Energy in the form of
heat liberates some electrons to support current flow. However, the
maximum current flow in a small block of semiconductor material is
too small to be of any practical use in electronic circuits.
The addition or doping of impurities within semiconductor materials produces either excess numbers of free electrons or mobile holes,
depending on the type of material used as the impurity. Figure 5.13
shows a pure semiconductor material and semiconductor materials
that have been doped with certain impurities. Both germanium and
silicon semiconductor materials exhibit these characteristics. Both
types of modified semiconductor materials, referred to as n-type and
p-type semiconductors, can be made to produce usable amounts of
current flow. Figure 5.13 shows a relative comparison of pure and
modified semiconductor material.

n-type semiconductor
If a tiny amount of doping material such as arsenic, antimony, or phosphorus is combined with the semiconductor material, the number of
free electrons is increased by a substantial amount. The n-type semiconductor material will support practical and usable amounts of electrical current from microamperes to amperes. By itself, n-type silicon
is used to manufacture resistors; the amount of resistance is a function
of the level of concentration of impurities and the geometric shape of
the section of the n-type material. Tiny n-type silicon paths of resistance are deposited in ICs to provide the required resistance for IC circuit operation.

p-type semiconductor
P-type semiconductor materials represent a relatively new concept in
electronics—“hole” current flow. When a semiconductor material
such as silicon is doped with aluminum, boron, or gallium, a substantial number of mobile or free holes are created in the atomic crystalline
structure. Actually, the holes represent the absence of an electron in an
outer electron orbit in many semiconductor atoms. These holes, capable of carrying positive charges through the p-type silicon, can support
a practical current from microamperes to amperes.

How semiconductor devices are made
Semiconductor diodes and transistors are formed from alternate layers
of n-type and p-type semiconductor materials. For example, pn junction diodes consist of a layer of n-type and p-type material. pnp or npn

transistors can be fabricated by forming three tiny blocks of p-n-p or np-n semiconductor materials, respectively. Figure 5.14 illustrates the
pn junction diode and pnp and npn transistor constructions, typical
schematic symbols, and representative packaging or cases. The type of

in “bipolar” pnp or npn transistors to provide amplification of small
input signals to large output signals similar to the triode vacuum tube.
This section concentrates on how the pn junction diode works.
A pn junction is formed when one half of a block of pure semiconductor material is doped with a trivalent impurity and the other half is doped
with a pentavalent impurity. The resulting pn junction creates an electrochemical force due to the excess holes in the p-type material and the
excess free electrons in the n-type material. This electrochemical force is
responsible for the operation of the pn junction diode and the transistor.
When the pn junction is formed, as shown in Fig. 5.15A, free electrons from the n-type material drift across the junction and immediately combine with the numerous holes present in the p-type material.
Thus some atoms in the p-type material gain additional electrons and
exhibit a net negative charge. As a group, these atoms, or negative ions,
form a negative electric field adjacent to the junction.
The loss of free electrons by the n-type material in the vicinity of
the junction leaves some atoms with a net positive charge. These
atoms, or positive ions, form a positive electric field next to the junction. Each pair of positive and negative ions are referred to as a dipole
(not to be associated with the dipole antenna, covered in Chapter 10).
The formation of negative and positive electric fields at the junction are shown in Fig. 5.15B. This region is referred to as the depletion
zone. The depletion zone shown in Fig. 5.15B is not drawn to scale.
Actually, the depletion zone is very thin, virtually a few atoms thick.
The resulting electric field, or barrier potential, varies with the type of
semiconductor material being used. For example, the barrier potential
at room temperature is approximately 0.3 volt for a germanium pn
junction and approximately 0.7 volt for a silicon pn junction. These
values of barrier potential are the most useful in describing the action
of pn junction diodes and transistors. Note that the p-type material in
the pn junction diode is referred to as the anode and the n-type material is referred to as the cathode. These designators represent a carryover from the vacuum tube era.
If the temperature of the pn junction is increased, the barrier potential is decreased by a slight amount due to the increased number of
electron-hole pairs, or dipoles. Temperature effects in semiconductor
materials must be taken into account when designing solid-state electronic circuits.

power diodes. (D) High-power rectifier diodes.
The pn junction diodes are available in
many sizes and case types. The basic pn
junction diode is used as a rectifier, either in high-current, low-frequency rectification circuits or in low-current, high-frequency, and
high-speed switching circuits. Power rectifier diodes are generally
larger, containing a larger junction area with increased capacitance.
Due to this larger capacitance, these diodes are not suitable for highfrequency or switching circuits. High-frequency signal diodes and
switching diodes used in digital circuits are physically smaller and
have less internal capacitance. Consequently, their current conducting
ability is less than the power diodes.
Approximately

How diodes work
The operation of pn junction diodes can be explained in terms of forward and reverse bias conditions. Forward biasing a diode simply
means that the anode terminal is connected to a positive voltage
potential, and the cathode terminal is connected to a negative voltage
potential. Figure 5.17A shows a battery connected across a diode in a
forward bias arrangement. (In practical circuits, this direct connection
will burn out the diode if the battery voltage is too high. A forward bias
voltage of several volts would destroy most diodes.)

FIGURE 5.17
Forward and reverse biasing a pn junction. (A) Forward-biased pn junction. (B) Reversebiased pn junction.

When the voltage across the diode is greater than the barrier potential of the pn junction, a forward current flows in the diode. This current flow is due to the electric field produced by the voltage across the
junction, which forces both free electrons and holes toward the junction. The barrier potential for a germanium pn junction is approximately 0.3 volt. When the voltage across the junction exceeds 0.3 volt,
this higher potential pushes free electrons and holes across the junction. Thus free electrons in the n-type material cross the junction and
drift toward the anode. At the same time, holes from the p-type material cross the junction, drifting toward the cathode end. These actions
result in a current flow that is proportional to the applied voltage.
The movement of holes and free electrons toward the junction
reduces the size of the depletion zone. As the external battery voltage
is increased, the depletion zone becomes progressively smaller and is
eventually eliminated for all practical purposes.

Reverse bias
Reverse biasing a pn junction diode simply means making the cathode
more positive than the anode. Figure 5.17B shows a battery connected

161

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

162 CHAPTER FIVE
across the diode in a reverse bias arrangement. The reverse current in
this circuit is very small, practically zero.
The action of the reverse voltage places a positive potential at the
cathode terminal or n-type material of the diode. This potential
attracts the free electrons and causes them to drift toward the cathode
terminal. At the same time, holes in the p-type material drift toward
the anode terminal because they are attracted to the negative potential.
This increases the size of the depletion zone because the departing free
electrons and holes create more positive ions in the n-type material
and more negative ions in the p-type material, respectively. The depletion zone expands to result in a barrier potential equal to the applied
reverse voltage. Thus, the current flow in the diode is virtually zero
due to equal and opposing voltages. Only a small leakage current is
present in the reverse biased diode. The pn junction acts as a one-way
switch, allowing current to flow in one direction, but restricting current flow in the other direction.

Diode circuits
The pn junction diode serves as a rectifier, converting alternating
current to unidirectional or one-way current flow. The simplest
diode circuit is the half-wave rectifier, shown in Fig. 5.18. Input and
output voltage ratings of power transformers are normally given in
rms or effective voltage levels. However, the diode rectifies the peak
value of the voltage waveform and provides a pulsating dc output

voltage level. The peak ac voltage is obtained by multiplying the rms
value by 1.414.
Two diodes can be connected to form a full-wave rectifier circuit
when the secondary winding of the transformer has a center tap. Figure 5.19 illustrates this type of full-wave rectifier circuit. The diodes
conduct on alternating half cycles of the ac waveform, each referenced
from the center tap of the secondary winding. Thus, only one-half of
the total peak-to-peak output voltage is used for each diode. Diode D1
conducts only when the ac voltage is positive, and diode D2 conducts
when the ac voltage is negative. The ground return is connected to the
center tap of the secondary winding. The current from either diode
flows through load resistor R in the same direction. Thus, the output
voltage is a varying dc voltage ranging from 0 to +8.5 volts. The primary disadvantage of the full-wave rectifier circuit is that the rectified
voltage peak is one half or less of the rated secondary voltage of the
transformer. The pulsating dc output of a full-wave rectifier has a frequency that is twice the ac input frequency.
The pn junction diodes can be used as clipper diodes, eliminating
either the positive or negative half of the input ac signal. Figure 5.20
shows a positive clipper circuit. The diode is forward biased during
the positive half of the ac signal and conducts this part of the signal to
ground. The negative half of the ac signal is unaffected because the
diode is reverse biased and does not conduct. A negative clipper circuit is shown in Fig. 5.21.

Special-Purpose Diodes
The unique properties of the pn junction make possible the construction of special-purpose diodes that exhibit useful characteristics. By
varying the doping process and manufacturing techniques, specialpurpose diodes can be made to perform as voltage regulators, voltagecontrolled capacitors, and negative-resistance devices.

The zener diode
As noted earlier, ordinary pn junction diodes can be destroyed if they
are subjected to the reverse bias breakdown voltage. The zener diode is
a unique silicon pn junction diode designed to operate in the reverse
bias breakdown mode. By controlling the doping levels, zener diodes
can be manufactured for specific breakdown voltage levels from about
2 to 200 volts. The constant breakdown-voltage-level characteristic
exhibited by the zener diode provides an extremely useful voltage-regulating device.
The zener diode is heavily doped, which results in a very narrow
depletion zone. When a reverse bias voltage is applied to the diode,

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

12:49 PM

Page 165

TUBES AND SEMICONDUCTORS

the intense electric field developed across the junction is sufficient to
dislodge valence or outer-orbit electrons in the material. These electrons are free to flow across the junction, resulting in current flow.
This current flow must be kept within manufacturers’ limits by connecting current-limiting resistors in series with the external voltage
source.
Symbols for the zener diode are given in Fig. 5.22. A typical application of the zener diode as a voltage regulator is shown in Fig. 5.23.
In this example, a 9-volt zener with a power dissipation of 3 watts is
used to provide a stable 9-volt source from a varying 11- to 14-volt

power supply. This type of voltage regulator can be used to power a
transistor radio from the electrical system of an automobile. With the
engine running, the electrical system of the automobile can supply up
to 14 volts from the generator or alternator. When the engine is shut
down, the voltage drops to about 12 volts if the battery is charged.
Regardless of the varying voltage supplied by the system, the zener
regulating circuit maintains a constant 9-volt supply to the transistor.

The varactor diode
The varactor diode, or simply varactor, is a voltage-controlled, variable-capacitance pn junction diode used for tuning radio-frequency
circuits to a desired resonant frequency. The varactor, a rugged, compact semiconductor device, represents an important advance in electronic technology. It is replacing the bulky mechanical variable
capacitors used in radio communications equipments for the past
some 75 years. Unlike the variable capacitor, the varactor is not
affected by dust or moisture and can be remotely controlled. Symbols
for the varactor are given in Fig. 5.24.
The capacitance of the pn junction diode can be increased by special
doping processes. This increased capacitance, on the order of 10 to 60
picofarads, allows the varactor to be operated in the reverse biased
mode with negligible current flow. Figure 5.25 shows a typical circuit
application using the varactor to tune an LC tank circuit. Coil L1 and
capacitor C1 form a resonant tank circuit, which is tuned to frequencies
by the varactor diode. Capacitor C2 isolates the tank circuit from the dc
power supply. Radio frequency choke RFC prevents any RF coupling
between the tank circuit and the power
supply. The varactor diode is reverse biased
and draws essentially no current from the
power supply. The varactor diode can provide a wide variation in capacitance, allowing for a considerable change in the
resonant frequency of the tank circuit.

Transistors

photograph are the small signal types and employ either metal or plastic cases. Power transistors are shown at the bottom. For specific information on transistor types and case information, transistor handbooks
are available at most electronic supply houses, such as Radio Shack.
Transistors fall into two general categories: bipolar (or junction)
transistors and field-effect transistors. Each class possesses unique
characteristics that are useful in various applications.
The bipolar transistor consists of three doped regions either in a
pnp or an npn arrangement. This creates two independent pn junctions that govern the operational characteristics of these devices.
Either type of bipolar transistor can be constructed from germanium or
silicon semiconductor material.

168 CHAPTER FIVE
Bipolar transistors are current-operated devices, producing a large
change in output current for a small change in input current. Therefore, the bipolar transistor has a low input resistance when compared
to the almost infinite input resistance of vacuum-tube circuits. Basic
amplifier circuits for the pnp and npn transistors are compared with
that of the triode vacuum tube in Fig. 5.27. The npn transistor circuit
is similar to the triode circuit in terms of power supply polarities. The
triode is connected as a common-cathode amplifier and the transistors
are connected as common-emitter amplifiers. The bias circuits, VCC for
the triode and VBB for the transistors, are shown in terms of separate
batteries to illustrate the potentials on each control element. However,
most tube and transistor circuits operate from a single power source
and the dc bias voltages are established by resistive networks.
The bipolar transistor is capable of providing high gain characteristics. Current and voltage gain ranges between 50 to 200 for most smallsignal transistors. Some transistors will exhibit current gain as high as
1000. In terms of gain characteristics, the bipolar transistor is superior
to the triode and is comparable to the pentode.
Field-effect transistors, or FETs, are different from the bipolar transistor in that an electric field is used to control the flow of current
within the device. Thus, the FET is a voltage-operated device with an
input resistance that is virtually infinite. The characteristic operating
curves for the FET are similar to those of the pentode tube. However,

FETs do not possess the high gain characteristics exhibited by bipolar
transistors or pentodes.
Field-effect transistors are generally divided into two types: the
junction FET (or JFET), and the insulated-gate FET (or IGFET). Sometimes the IGFET is referred to as a metal-oxide semiconductor FET or
MOSFET. Symbols for the JFET and IGFET are given in Fig. 5.28.

Bipolar transistor construction
At first glance, the bipolar transistor might appear to be simply two pn
junction diodes connected back to back. However, each of the elements
(emitter, base, and collector) is carefully manufactured with different
specifications to obtain different characteristics. Figure 5.29 shows the
basic layout for an npn transistor. The n-type emitter is heavily doped,
producing many free electrons that can be emitted toward the base
region. The base is a very narrow layer of lightly doped p-type material
containing a small number of holes. Finally, the n-type collector, moderately doped to produce a limited number of free electrons, is
designed to collect free electrons that drift across the base material
from the emitter. The collector is the largest element because it must
dissipate more heat than either the emitter or base elements.

emitter circuit, the base-collector pn junction prevents any flow of current. However, the emitter-base np junction is forward biased and this
causes a flow of free electrons toward the base region.
Most of the free electrons entering the base drift across the narrow
region and pass into the collector. Only a few of these free electrons
combine with the limited number of holes in the base region. This

results in a small current of about 5 percent or less of the total emitter
current. Thus, some 95 percent of the free electrons pass through the
base to the positive collector. This action is responsible for the amplifying ability of the transistor.

pnp transistor operation
A pnp transistor operates in the same basic manner as an npn transistor except that holes are emitted by the emitter instead of electrons.
Note in Fig. 5.31 that the polarities of the batteries are reversed when
compared to those for the npn transistor. The emitter-base pn junction
is forward biased, causing holes in the emitter to drift toward the base.
Most of these holes drift across the narrow region of the base and into
the collector. Some 5 percent or less of the holes crossing into the base
material combine with free electrons and produce a small base current. Thus, 95 percent or more of the current produced by the emitterbase pn junction flows through the base to the negative collector.

Common-base amplifying circuits
The npn and pnp transistors in Figs. 5.30 and 5.31 are connected in
the common-base configuration. This is one of the three basic circuits
applicable to transistors. The common-emitter and the common-collector configurations are discussed later.

(Eq. 5.2)

Because IC can never exceed IE the α of a transistor is always less
than one. The value of α will range from about 0.95 to 0.99, depending
on the gain characteristics of the transistor.
Figure 5.32 shows a basic pnp common-base amplifier circuit. The
signal from the ac generator is coupled to the emitter via a dc-blocking
capacitor, C1. The output signal is taken from the collector through the
dc-blocking capacitor, C2, and can be connected to a following stage
for additional amplification if required. The emitter-base pn junction
is forward biased by battery VBB. Emitter resistor RE is a current-limiting
resistor. Thus, battery VBB and resistor RE establish a dc operating current before an ac input signal is applied to the amplifier.

TUBES AND SEMICONDUCTORS

The amplifying action of the common-base configuration is based on
the ac input signal varying the forward bias across the emitter-base pn
junction. This varying voltage produces a change in the current flowing
from the emitter toward the base region. As stated earlier, most of the current flows through the narrow base region into the collector. Thus, the current flowing into the collector circuit varies essentially the same as the
emitter current and produces an ac voltage drop across the load resistor, RL.
The ac output voltage developed across RL is large compared to the
ac input signal voltage. This is due to RL being many times the value of
the input resistance of the emitter-base circuit. The input resistance of
the common-base configuration, referred to as the emitter resistance
Re, is typically less than 100 ohms and can be as low as 10 ohms or
less. This is due to the fact that the emitter-base junction is forward
biased, presenting a low resistance. Conversely, the collector output
resistance is extremely high, on the order of 300 k to 500 k.
To provide a useful output from a common-base amplifier, such as
driving a subsequent stage of amplification, load resistor RL is typically
on the order of 2 k to 10 k. The voltage gain of the common-base configuration can be approximated by:

The common-base configuration does not provide current gain
because the collector output current is always slightly less than the
input current in the emitter circuit. Due to this limitation and the
extremely low input resistance, the common-base configuration is not
widely used in solid-state circuits.

Common-emitter amplifier circuits
The common-emitter configuration is the most useful of the three
basic transistor circuits. Both npn and pnp common-emitter circuits
are illustrated in Fig. 5.33.

The collector current, on the order of a few milliamperes, flows in the
collector-emitter circuit.
The ac signal input to this amplifier is coupled to the base via a dc
blocking capacitor, C1. Battery VBB and base-current-limiting resistor RB
provide a dc operating base current. The ac input signal voltage variations produce a corresponding variation in the dc base-emitter current.
This action in turn varies the collector current, resulting in current
amplification.
Current gain in a common-emitter configuration is determined by
the ratio of change in collector current to change in base current.
This quantity is expressed as beta (β). In mathematical terms, beta is
given as:
IC
β
(Eq. 5.4)
IB
where
β is beta or current gain
IC is the change in collector current caused by the varying input
signal
IB is the change in base current caused by the varying input signal
The beta of most small-signal transistors will range from about 40
to 200, with some high-gain transistors having a beta of up to 1000.
For example, if a 10-microampere change in base current produces a
500-microampere change in collector current, the resulting beta is
500/10, or 50.
The base input resistance of common-emitter transistor circuits is
normally on the order of 500 to 5000 ohms. The collector output resistance is about 50,000 ohms. These moderate input and output resistances, along with high voltage and current gain, make the
common-emitter configuration a valuable circuit for solid-state design.
The voltage gain of the common-emitter configuration is comparable to that of the common-base configuration—normally on the order
of 100 to 1000. This voltage gain along with high current gain produces a power gain of 10,000 or more for the common-emitter configuration. The phase of the amplified output signal produced by the
common-emitter amplifier is reversed when compared to the input
signal, i.e., as the ac input signal increases from zero to a positive
level, the ac output signal drops from zero to a negative level. This is
due to the increasing positive voltage on the base that causes the col-

175

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

176 CHAPTER FIVE
lector current to increase, thus decreasing the collector voltage. Conversely, an increasing negative voltage on the base reduces the collector current, causing the collector voltage to rise.

Common-emitter design considerations
Solid-state design is a complex and wide-ranging aspect of electronics
that includes many types of semiconductor devices and circuits. Many
excellent texts are available that cover practical and theoretical details
of this subject. Because space is not available in this handbook to
cover all aspects of solid-state design, a procedure for designing a simple common-emitter amplifier circuit is given here.
Most transistor circuits operate from a single common power
source. The simple npn amplifier in Fig. 5.34 uses a single 9-volt battery for both base-biasing and collector-supply requirements. The current flowing in base-biasing resistor RB establishes a dc operating
current for a no-signal input condition.

A 2N3904 npn silicon transistor is used in this circuit. The 2N3904,
similar to the Sylvania ECG123A or the Radio Shack RS-2030, is
designed for general-purpose amplifier and switching applications.
Applicable ratings for the 2N3904 transistor, available in most transistor handbooks, are as follows:

Current gain (Beta)

100 to 400, Average  125

Input impedance

1 k to 4 k, Average  3.5 k

The 2N3904 is capable of handling currents of up to 200 mA. However, for small-signal applications an IC of about 1 mA is recommended.
This smaller static or dc current will result in a higher input impedance
(or resistance) for the base-emitter circuit and ensure linear amplification of small ac signals. Also, the small collector current results in very
little power dissipation within the transistor and minimizes power supply drain. For battery-powered applications, this latter advantage is all
important.
The dc collector-emitter voltage, VCE, is normally established as onehalf of the supply voltage, VCC. In this example, VCE will be equal to onehalf of 9 V, or 4.5 V. The value of RC can be calculated from the
following equation:

The base resistor, RB, can now be calculated based on IB  8 A.
The base-emitter pn junction is forward biased, resulting in a voltage
drop of approximately 0.7 volt for silicon transistors. (If a germanium
transistor is used in this type of circuit, the base-emitter voltage, VBE,
is approximately 0.3 volt.) Therefore, if VCC is 9 volts and VBE is 0.7 volt,
the voltage drop across base resistor RB is 9 – 0.7 or 8.3 volts. The
equation for determining RB is:

The values of dc blocking capacitors C1 and C2 are selected to provide a low-impedance path for the input and output signals. For example, if the amplifier is designed for an audio frequency response from
200 Hz to 3 kHz, the capacitive reactance, XC, of each capacitor should
not exceed a given value over this frequency range. Because XC varies
inversely with frequency (remember, XC  1⁄2 πfc), its value will be
greatest at the lower frequencies. A 4-µF capacitor will present an XC of
about 200 ohms at 200 Hz. Considering the input resistance (about
3500 ohms) and the output resistance (about 4500 ohms) for the transistor amplifier, the 200-ohm capacitive reactance of the blocking
capacitors will offer little opposition to the input and output signals.

The preliminary design for the small-signal amplifier using the
2N3904 transistor is now complete and can be breadboarded for initial
testing. The current gain is approximately 125, based on the average
beta for this transistor. However, what happens if the 2N3904 transistor obtained for this circuit has a different beta, say 300? This poses a
problem that is inherent in this design procedure.

Variations in transistor characteristics
Unlike vacuum tubes, the characteristics of transistors will vary during manufacturing processes. For example, the common-emitter current gain, or beta, for the 2N3904 transistor might range from about 100
to 400. If the previous circuit design was based on a beta of 125, a
2N3904 with a beta of 400 will not perform as expected in this circuit.
The increased current gain will result in a higher collector current,
lowering the desired collector-emitter voltage.
An experimental approach may be used to determine the optimum
value of the base resistor, RB. The value of RB is critical in controlling
the collector current. Thus, RB can be determined experimentally by
substituting a variable resistor in the circuit and varying the resistance
for the required collector-emitter voltage of 4.5 volts. A recommended
procedure for determining the proper value of base resistor RB is:
■ With VCC (9 volts in this circuit) applied to the amplifier, measure

the value of VCE. If the measured value of VCE is within about 10
percent of the required value, the original calculations are adequate and no changes are required. If the measured value of VCE is
not within 10 percent of the required value, that is, below 4 volts
or above 5 volts, the value of RB should be changed to obtain the
correct VCE.
■ Figure 5.35 illustrates how a variable resistor network can be

temporarily installed in the base-biasing circuit (between points
A and B). Note that a fixed resistor is used along with the potentiometer in order to prevent excessive base current. The total
range of this resistive network can be varied from 0.5 to 3.5
megohms.
■ With 9 volts applied to the circuit, adjust the variable resistor

to obtain a VCE of 4.5 volts. Remove power from the circuit and

Note that the current ratio, ic /ib, is the beta of the transistor. Sometimes the beta for a specific dc operating level, such as a specified collector current of 1 mA, is termed the ac current gain or Ai.
The approximate voltage gain, Av, for the circuit in Fig. 5.34 is calculated using a beta of 125, an input base-emitter resistance of 3.5 k,
and a 4.5-k collector load resistor, RC.

If a 10-millivolt, peak-to-peak signal is applied to the input of this

This compares favorably with the 3500 ohms specified by the manufacturer.
This completes the design calculations for the small-signal amplifier using the 2N3904 transistor. In general, this design is valid for
audio and low-frequency applications. When radio-frequency amplifier circuit design is required, many factors must be taken into consideration. For example, the frequency response of the transistor will
affect circuit design.

Frequency limitations of transistors
Many factors affect the frequency response of a transistor. These factors include physical construction characteristics, electron transit
time between the emitter and collector, interelement capacitance, and

circuit configuration. Some transistors provide usable gain in the hundreds of megahertz while others will not operate at frequencies over 50
kHz.
Manufacturers’ specifications or transistor handbooks usually provide one or more parameters that describe the performance of transistors as a function of frequency. The three most common frequency
parameters are as follows:
■ Common-emitter or beta cutoff frequency, fb. This is the fre-

quency at which the ac gain for the common-emitter configuration drops to 70 percent of its value at low frequencies.
Sometimes this parameter is referred to as fae or fhfe. For example
the fb for the 2N2342 npn silicon transistor is rated at 550 kHz.
The ac beta or ac current gain for this transistor at low frequencies will range from 10 to 40 with an average of about 25. If the
frequency of operation is increased to 550 kHz, the average ac
beta of 25 will drop by 70 percent, or to about 17.5. For frequencies above 550 kHz, the ac beta drops sharply.
■ Common-base or alpha cutoff frequency, fT. Sometimes referred

to as fab or fhfb, this parameter describes the frequency at which the
ac alpha gain drops to 70 percent of its value at low frequencies.
■ Common-emitter gain-bandwidth product frequency, fT. The fT is

defined as the frequency for which beta or ac current gain has
dropped to unity or 1.

The common-collector configuration
The third basic transistor configuration is the common-collector or
emitter follower, illustrated in Fig. 5.36. Either npn or pnp transistors
can be used in these circuits. The only difference is that the power
supply polarity is reversed.
The three useful characteristics of the common-collector configuration are:
■ Extremely high input resistance, ranging up to 500 k.
■ Very low output resistance, from about 50 to 1000 ohms.
■ Current gain approximately equal to the beta rating of the tran-

sistor.

Common-collector configurations. (A) An npn common-collector amplifier. (B) A pnp

The primary advantage of the common-collector configuration is its
ability to act as an impedance-matching device, transforming a highimpedance, low-current signal to a low-impedance, high-current signal.
In this sense, the common-collector configuration acts as a step-down
transformer. Unlike the transformer with a limited frequency response
and no power gain, the common-collector configuration operates over a
wide frequency range, approximately equal to the beta cutoff frequency,
fb, rating of the transistor. The current gain of the common-collector circuit is approximately equal to the beta of the transistor.
The common-collector circuit is similar to the common-emitter circuit in terms of signal input and biasing arrangements. However, the
common-collector configuration does not provide voltage gain. Note
that the output signal is taken from the emitter terminal that is always
at a lower potential than the base terminal. This difference of potential
is approximately 0.7 volt for silicon transistors and 0.3 volt for germanium transistors. The collector terminal in the common-collector configuration is connected directly to the power source, VCC. Capacitor CC
allows the signal developed at the collector to be bypassed to ground.
This places the collector terminal at an ac ground potential and the
output signal is developed across the emitter resistor, RE.
The common-collector circuits in Fig. 5.36 employ voltage-divider
biasing, also used for the common-emitter configuration. This circuit

compensates for the wide variations in current gain (beta), temperature characteristics, and aging encountered in transistors. However,
the simple resistor bias network or a separate bias supply can be used
if desired.

Summary of transistor characteristics
Technical information and specifications for particular transistors are
available in manufacturers’ specification sheets and transistor handbooks. Most handbooks provide a cross-reference listing for replacement purposes. Transistor characteristic curves, available in many of
these publications, are useful in specific design problems. These
curves usually show collector current-and-voltage relationships for
common-base and common-emitter configurations.
Gain and resistance characteristics for the three basic transistor
configurations are given in Table 5.2. This data is typical of the voltage
gain, current gain, input resistance, and output resistance for smallsignal transistors.

Transistor testing
In-circuit testing of equipment using transistors is best accomplished
with the aid of a schematic diagram that provides key voltage and
resistance test data. Defective transistors or other components often
can be quickly located by analyzing voltage and resistance readings.

A close visual inspection for loose connections, short circuits, or
poor solder joints is a prerequisite for any troubleshooting of transistor
circuits. Such preliminary efforts can save many hours of investigating
erroneous indications.
Voltage measurements should be made with voltmeters possessing
a sensitivity of 20,000 ohms per volt or greater. Otherwise, the internal
resistance of the voltmeter might change the transistor biasing circuit
and show incorrect voltage readings. Vacuum tube voltmeters (VTVM)
or transistorized voltmeters (TVM) with input impedances on the
order of 11 megohms are preferred for these types of measurements.
Digital voltmeters are especially suited to voltage measurements in
transistor circuits. Key voltage measurements in any transistor circuit
should include base-emitter bias voltage and collector and emitter
voltages.
Commercial in-circuit transistor testers are available for checking
individual transistors wired into the circuit. However, some knowledge of the particular circuit might be required to ensure a thorough
test of the transistor. For example, coils, transformers, resistors, and
forward-biased diodes can produce low-resistance shunts across the
transistor elements.

Transistor testing with ohmmeters
Front-to-back resistance measurements involving both pn junctions is
a simple but effective way to determine the general condition of a transistor. However, this test does not give the alpha or beta current-gain
values or other performance characteristics expected from the transistor. The ohmmeter test is best accomplished with the transistor
removed from the circuit. Only a detailed examination of the particular circuit involved will indicate if the transistor can be tested while
wired in the circuit.
Before attempting to use the ohmmeter for testing transistors, determine the polarity of the ohmmeter test leads due to the internal battery. Normally, the positive terminal of the battery will be connected to
the red (positive) test lead. An external voltmeter can be used to verify
this polarity. This information is helpful in identifying npn or pnp
transistors.
Avoid using any ohmmeter range that can cause excessive current
to flow within the transistor. For example, the maximum base-emitter

185

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

186 CHAPTER FIVE
voltage for many transistors will range between 3 to 6 volts. Ohmmeters employing internal battery voltages exceeding 3 volts can damage
or destroy a good transistor. Also, the R × 1 scale in most ohmmeters
will allow excessive current to flow in the pn junctions of the transistors, causing permanent damage. Never use the R × 1 scale; the R × 10
or R × 100 scale is generally safe for testing transistors and will provide
adequate resistance readings.
The test procedure is based on considering the transistor as two individual pn junction diodes. Figure 5.37 shows the pnp and npn transistors in the initial stage of testing forward biasing. Each internal pn
junction is represented as a diode. The solid-line connections are used
for checking the forward resistance of the collector-base pn junction of
either transistor. When this reading is obtained, the lead connected to the
collector is moved to the emitter terminal. This provides the forward
resistance reading for the emitter-base pn junction. To obtain the reverse
resistance readings for each junction, simply reverse the test leads and
repeat the procedure just described.
In either type of transistor, pnp or npn, the ohmmeter is used to
check the forward-biased resistance of the collector-base and emitterbase junctions. Record these readings and reverse the ohmmeter test

leads and repeat the resistance reading. This provides the reversebiased resistance readings for both junctions. In general, a high frontto-back ratio of resistance (about 100 to 1) should be obtained for each
junction of germanium transistors. The front-to-back resistance ratio
for silicon transistor junctions can exceed 1,000,000 to 1. Table 5.3
shows typical values of resistance measurements for both small-signal
and power transistors.

Field-Effect Transistors
Field-effect transistors, like vacuum tubes, use an electric field to
control the flow of current within the device. This permits the control
element, called a gate, to exhibit an extremely high input resistance
in the range of hundreds to thousands of megohms. This desirable
characteristic, along with an ability to provide amplification, makes
the field-effect transistor, or FET, a valuable component for solid-state
circuit design.
There are basically two types of field-effect transistors—the junction field-effect transistor, or JFET, and the insulated-gate field-effect

transistor, or IGFET. The IGFET is also referred to as a metal-oxide
semiconductor FET, or MOSFET.

The junction field-effect transistor
The JFET is basically a tiny bar of doped silicon that acts as a resistor.
This bar, referred to as a channel, can be constructed from either ntype or p-type silicon material. Figure 5.38 shows a cross-sectional
view of a simple n-channel JFET. The n-channel material contains
many free electrons capable of sustaining a usable current through the
device. The terminals connecting each end of the n-channel to an output circuit are designated as source and drain.
The gate consists of doped silicon material opposite to that of the
channel material. The gate is normally embedded in the channel material by a diffusion process. In Fig. 5.38, the gate is made of p-type silicon material.

TUBES AND SEMICONDUCTORS

The pn junctions formed within the device produce depletion
zones, the widths of which can be controlled by placing a voltage
potential between the gate and channel material. Reverse biasing these
pn junctions results in expanding the depletion zones and restricting
the flow of free electrons within the n-channel. Thus, current flow
depends on the size of the depletion zone, which in turn is controlled
by the voltage on the gate terminal. If the depletion region extends
across the width of the n-channel, current flow is cut off. The value of
the gate voltage, VGS, which reduces the current flow to zero is called
the pinch-off voltage.
Maximum current flow in the channel material occurs when the
gate voltage is zero. This is equivalent to the gate being shorted to the
source terminal. Most JFET specification sheets provide the typical
value of the shorted-gate drain current. This current is designated as
IDSS. The subscript DDS is defined as drain to source with shorted gate.
The value of IDSS is used in designing JFET circuits.
Because the pn junctions in JFETs are operated in the reversebiased mode, negligible current flows in the junction. This accounts
for the extremely high input resistance at the gate terminal.
The p-channel JFETs are constructed with silicon p-type channel
material and n-type gates. The p-channel contains many holes or positive charge carriers, which are capable of conducting a usable current
through the device. As anticipated, the power supply polarities and
direction of current flow are reversed for p-channel JFETs when compared to n-channel. Figures 5.39 and 5.40 show both n- and p-channel
JFETs with different biasing circuits. The circuits in Fig. 5.39 employ
separate power sources for gate biasing. Figure 5.40 shows n- and pchannel JFET amplifiers, each with single power sources and voltagedivider biasing networks. The dc gate bias voltage, VGS, is developed by
voltage-divider network R1 R2 and the voltage drop across source
resistor RS. Capacitor CS bypasses any ac signals to ground while maintaining a dc voltage level between the source terminal and ground.

Characteristics of junction field-effect transistors
One of the major advantages of the JFET is its extremely high input
resistance, which approaches infinity for most circuits. However, this
high input resistance results in less control over output drain current,
or in effect, less voltage amplification. The effective voltage gain of a

JFET is substantially less than that of the bipolar transistor. The voltage gain of JFET amplifiers is typically on the order of 5 to 50 as compared to 100 to 200 for bipolar transistors. The current gain
characteristics of JFETs are much superior to that of bipolar transistors. In fact, these gain values approach infinity because virtually no
current flows in the JFET input circuit.

JFET circuit configurations
JFETs can be employed in three basic circuit configurations: common
source, common gate, and common drain. Similar in performance to

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

the three basic bipolar transistor configurations, these circuits are
also valid for the insulated-gate field-effect transistors, or IGFET
devices.
Figure 5.41 and Table 5.4 show these three basic circuits and
related characteristics. The transistors used in these circuits are nchannel devices. For p-channel devices, the power supply polarities
and directions of current flow are reversed.

Insulated-gate field-effect transistors
IGFET transistors, sometimes referred to as metal-oxide semiconductor
field-effect transistors, or MOSFETs, are similar in performance to JFETs.
Gate biasing methods used for JFETs are, in general, applicable to IGFETs.
There are two basic types of insulated-gate field-effect transistors:
depletion-mode and enhancement-mode IGFETs. The depletion-mode
IGFET operates in a manner similar to that of the junction field-effect
transistor. However, the depletion-mode device does not use a pn junction to produce the depletion zone. As illustrated in Fig. 5.42, the gate is
insulated from the channel material by a thin layer of metal oxide. The
n-type material, heavily doped to provide many free electrons, is embedded in a base of lightly doped p-type material. This base material is
referred to as the substrate.

Depletion-mode IGFET operation
Either n- or p-channel semiconductor material can be used to construct IGFETs. The depletion-mode IGFET in Fig. 5.42 shows an nchannel type with one gate. This gate and the narrow n-channel form
a capacitor with the metal-oxide insulator acting as a dielectric.

FIGURE 5.42
Depletion-mode n-channel insulated-gate field-effect transistor (IGFET).

When the gate potential is zero volts, current flows through the nchannel due to the abundance of free electrons or negative-charge carriers. The positive potential on the drain terminal attracts the free
electrons within the n-channel, causing current flow. The depletionmode IGFET is considered a normally on device—current flows in the
channel material when the gate is at zero potential.
If a positive voltage is connected to the gate terminal, the gate side
of the capacitor assumes a positive potential and the n-channel material assumes a negative potential. This causes more free electrons to be
induced into the n channel and, hence, more current flow within the
device. Note in contrast that the gate on an n-channel JFET is never
allowed to become positive. This is one major difference between the
operation of IGFETs and JFETs.
When the IGFET gate is connected to a negative potential, the capacitance of the gate and the n-channel produces a positive charge in the
n-channel material. This reduces the number of free electrons within
the n-channel material, in effect creating a depletion zone. Subse-

194 CHAPTER FIVE
quently, the current flow within the device is reduced. As the negative
gate voltage is increased, the drain current is finally reduced to zero.
Depletion-mode IGFETs can be constructed with p-channel semiconductor material embedded in an n-type substrate. When using
these p-channel devices, power supply polarities must be reversed
from that used for n-channel devices. Note that the direction of current
flow will also be reversed.
Dual-gate depletion-mode IGFETs contain two independent gate
structures, each capable of controlling the drain current. These
devices are useful as mixers or gain-controlled amplifiers in mixer, RF,
and IF stages of receivers.
Some IGFETs are available with zener-diode input networks to protect the gates from accidental exposure to high voltage such as static
electrical discharges. The extremely thin metal-oxide insulating material can easily be punctured and permanently damaged by excessive
high voltage between the gate and other terminals of the device. The
zener diodes are connected back-to-back across each gate to provide a
discharge path for excessive voltages appearing across these terminals.
During normal operation, the zener diodes do not conduct and, thus
do not load the input circuit.
Symbols for the depletion-mode IGFETs are given in Fig. 5.43.

Enhancement-mode insulated-gate field-effect transistors
A major difference in the operation of enhancement-mode IGFETs as
compared to depletion-mode IGFETs is that they act as normally off
devices. Drain current flows only when a potential, equal in polarity to
that of the drain supply, is applied to the gate terminal.
Enhancement-mode IGFETs are designated as either p-channel or nchannel devices. Figure 5.44 illustrates a p-channel depletion-mode
IGFET. This device consists of a tiny block of lightly doped n-type material with separate drain and source p-type regions embedded or diffused
in the block. The metal gate, separated from the block by a thin layer of
metal-oxide insulating material, overlaps the drain and source regions.
As in the case of the depletion-mode IGFET, the gate and semiconductor
material form two plates of a capacitor, with the insulating material serving as a dielectric.
When there is no potential on the gate terminal, no conduction
path exists for source-to-drain current flow. When a negative poten-

tial is applied to the gate, holes or positive-charge carriers are
induced into the region forming the capacitor plate. Because the drain
is at a negative potential, these holes flow into the drain region.
Therefore, a positive charge flows within the device. Increasing the
negative potential on the gate terminal produces a corresponding
increase in drain current.
The n-channel enhancement-mode IGFETs are similar in construction to the p-channel device. However, the substrate is formed from
lightly doped p-type material, and drain and source regions are
embedded or diffused n-type material. As anticipated, the power
source polarity, gate polarity, and direction of current flow are
reversed when compared to the n-channel device. A positive gate
potential is required to “turn on” the drain current in the n-channel

Care and handling of insulated-gate semiconductor devices
Insulated-gate field-effect transistors are extremely susceptible to permanent damage when subjected to excessive high voltages and currents. For example, normal static electricity that exists on the human
body and test probes can puncture the gate structure on IGFETs that do
not have zener-diode protective networks. Maximum voltage and current ratings as specified in manufacturers’ data sheets or transistor
handbooks should never be exceeded.
Extreme care must be exercised in handling, testing, and installing
insulated-gate devices. The device leads should be kept shorted
together until the device is installed and soldered in the required circuit. Most IGFETs are shipped by the manufacturer with the leads
shorted together in some fashion such as by a shorting wire or conductive foam packing.

As IGFETs cannot be safely tested with ohmmeters, two alternate
means of testing are recommended if a commercial IGFET tester is not
available:
■ Check the device installed in the original circuit using the man-

ufacturer’s recommended test procedures. This might include
specific resistance measurements with the power off and voltage
and signal waveform analysis with the power on. This type of
test procedure usually leads to the identification of the defective
component.
■ Replace the suspect IGFET with a substitute IGFET that is

known to be good. If no direct replacement is available, a similar
device can be found using cross-reference listings in transistor
handbooks. The device leads should be left shorted together
until it is installed and soldered in the circuit. Soldering iron
tips and tools should be shorted to the circuit ground during
installation. Finally, no test signals should be applied to the
IGFET input circuit with the drain power source turned off.

Optoelectronic Devices
Semiconductor technology has made possible the development of
many specialized semiconductor devices for electronic functions such
as light detection and display. The optoelectronics family includes the
light emitting display (LED), liquid crystal display (LCD), photodiode,

phototransistor, and optocoupler. The
electronic display devices are used to display frequency and other information in
amateur radios, and alphanumeric displays for computers. Photodiodes and
phototransistors are used to detect the
presence and intensity of light energy.
Many modern amateur radios use the
above devices to control and display operating information such as frequency, modulation modes, signal power levels, and
memories.

Photodiodes
Photodiodes are light-sensitive devices
made with semiconductor materials.
There are two basic types of photodiodes,
the photoconductive and photovoltaic
diodes. Each type detects the presence of
light.
The photoconductive diode requires a
reverse bias voltage for proper operation.
Light waves striking an exposed pn junction cause a sizable increase in current
flowing through the device. This increase
in current can be used to switch on a tranC
sistor which, in turn, can be used to actiFIGURE 5.46

energy contained in light waves striking
the device into electrical energy. The typical photovoltaic diode has a large exposed pn junction upon which the
light waves are directed. The schematic symbol for the photodiode is
shown in Fig. 5.46A.
As you might suspect, exposed pn junctions of bipolar npn or pnp
transistors can be used as sensitive light detectors. Such phototransistors are used in fiber-optic and other applications.

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

TUBES AND SEMICONDUCTORS

Light-emitting diodes
The light-emitting diode, or LED, represents a major improvement in
visual display capability. Virtually all new amateur radios employ
LEDs to provide frequency display. With its rugged construction, small
compact size, and almost unlimited life expectancy, the LED can be
switched on and off at a very high rate.
LEDs use a forward-biased pn junction that radiates energy in the
form of light waves. This radiation is due to free electrons crossing the
pn junction into the p-type region and combining with holes in this
region. Usually a high-efficiency semiconductor material, such as gallium or phosphorus, is used in manufacturing LEDs. These materials
allow construction of LEDs with radiation wavelengths in the red,
green, or yellow regions of a visual spectrum.
Most LEDs require a forward bias voltage of about 1.2 volts and a
current of about 15 to 20 milliamperes. Segmented displays for letters
or numbers consist of many LEDs connected in series. Digital frequency displays for receivers and the numeric displays of pocket calculators are typical examples of LED display devices.
Figure 5.46B and 5.46C shows the schematic symbols for LEDs and
a typical seven-segment LED display.

LCD displays
The LCD, or liquid crystal display, is a popular display device used in
amateur radios, pocket calculators, miniature TV sets, and portable or
“laptop” computers to display alphanumeric and graphic information.
Most LCDs are configured as seven-segment displays to permit display
of numeric and limited alpha characters. The operation of an LCD is
different from the LED in that the LCD does not generate a light; it suppresses reflected or incident light on an LCD segment. This produces a
dark area on the LCD segment. LCD displays cannot be used in the
dark or low light levels. In many applications, an external light source
is provided to permit reading the displayed information.
The operation of LCDs is based on polarization characteristics of
light. The nematic liquid crystal material in the nonactivated LCD segments reflects incident rays of light in a normal manner; this causes
the LCD segment to appear invisible. Applying a voltage potential to
the LCD segment and backplane activates the LCD segment, producing

199

Ch05_Laster_136187-1

12:49 PM

Page 200

200 CHAPTER FIVE
a random scattering of incident light. This effect makes the LCD segment appear dark to an observer.
Unlike the LEDs and other optical displays, LCDs require very low
operating voltages and currents. Such an advantage is important in the
use of battery operated equipments. Another advantage is that LCDs
are readable in bright sunlight; LEDs tend to “fade out” under these
conditions. Thus, LCD indicators are very popular in mobile amateur
radios. Figure 5-46C shows a schematic symbol for an LCD seven-segment display device.

Integrated Circuits
The development of the integrated circuit, or IC, in the late 1950s has
revolutionized the electronics industry. The ability to implement a
complete electronic circuit consisting of thousands of transistors,
diodes, resistors, and capacitors on a single tiny chip simply could not
be envisioned in the days of the vacuum tube. This fantastic reduction
in size, along with mass production techniques and resultant cost
reductions, is one of the major accomplishments of this century. The
cost of a typical IC is less than that of a conventional vacuum tube.

Types of integrated circuits
There are four basic types of integrated circuits: monolithic, thin film,
thick film, and hybrid. Each type involves different methods of construction with varying advantages, performance characteristics, and
costs.
The monolithic IC uses a single chip of semiconductor material on
which are formed the many individual components and interconnecting circuitry. This base, or substrate, can be either n- or p-type material. Diffusion or growth techniques are used to assemble transistors,
diodes, resistors, and capacitors on this tiny chip. Inductors are seldom incorporated within ICs due to the large physical size of practical
coils. When required, external connections are provided for separate
inductors.
Integrated circuits are produced in batches of about 25 to several
hundred chips on a single wafer. When all individual components and
interconnecting circuitry have been formed on each chip, the wafer is
cut into separate chips. These chips are tested with automatic test

machines which check the quality and performance of the mass-produced chips. Figure 5.47 shows an enlargement of a microprocessor or
a computer-on-a-chip.
The thin-film IC is similar to the monolithic IC except that the base
material is composed of an insulating material such as glass or

ceramic. This type of construction is used when a high degree of insulation between components is required.
Thick-film technology uses deposited resistors and capacitors on a
common substrate. Individual transistors and diode chips are added as
discrete components. Hybrid ICs, similar to thick-film ICs, combine
monolithic and thin-film components on a ceramic base. Thick-film
and hybrid ICs are usually produced in limited quantities for specialized applications.

A typical IC—the 555 timer
Figure 5.48 shows the technical specifications for the Signetics 555
timer. This IC was used in the code-practice oscillator described in
Chap. 2. As indicated in Fig. 5.48, the 555 timer is available in either
an 8-pin or a 14-pin DIP (dual in-line package). The 555 timer is a versatile linear IC. It has been used in numerous applications. Many technical articles in radio and electronics magazines have been devoted to
projects involving the 555 timer.

Packaging of integrated circuits
Normally IC clips are mounted in plastic cases with connecting leads
suitable for either installing in sockets or soldering in printed-circuit
boards. Figure 5.49 shows a typical 14-pin DIP or TO-116 case. Other
ICs are available in many configurations including the standard TO5 transistor case, 10-pin ceramic flat packs, and 16- to 40-pin DIP
cases.

Linear and digital integrated circuits
In general, ICs can be classified as either linear or digital. Linear ICs
can contain many individual transistors, diodes, or complete amplifier
circuits designed for specific applications. These linear functions
include amplification of ac signals ranging from audio to radio frequencies, modulators, demodulators, and oscillators. Figure 5.50
shows an IC containing all the semiconductors required for an AM
radio.
Digital ICs contain digital logic elements, such as gates, inverters,
flip-flops, counters, and microprocessors—virtually a complete computer on a single chip. Two expressions are sometimes used to

Power Supplies

T

he operation of your amateur radio equipment either solid-state or
vacuum-tube type, requires a stable source of dc power. Batteries
can be used to provide power for portable, mobile, or low-power
“QRP” rigs. However, the ac power line is more appropriate for fixedstation operation involving high-power transmitters. Power supplies
are used to convert the ac line power to the required dc operation.
A trend in modern-day amateur equipment, such as HF and VHF
solid-state transceivers, is to design for 12- to 13.5-Vdc power requirements. With separate ac-line-operated power supplies, this equipment
offers the flexibility of both portable/mobile and fixed-station use. Some
transceivers have internal power supplies that are operable from either
a 12- to 13.5-Vdc power source or a 120-Vac, 60-Hz power source.
Power-supply design today is focused on two separate types: the more
conventional diode rectifer, capacitor filter, and electronic voltage regulator power supply; and the more recently developed electronic “switching” power supply. The first type—covered in this book—is more suitable
for home design and construction and will provide stable dc power for
amateur equipment with a modest investment of time and money. The
electronic switching power supply, a more recent development, is generally much smaller in size and provides improved efficiency. However,
the design and construction of the switching power supply is beyond the
scope of this book and most beginners in amateur radio.

Definitions
Diode A diode is a two-element device that allows current flow in
one direction but restricts or eliminates current flow in the opposite
direction. Diodes are used in power supplies to rectify the ac current.
Diodes can be either vacuum tubes or semiconductor devices and are
illustrated in Fig. 6.1.
Half-wave rectifier Normally consisting of a single diode, the halfwave rectifier allows only half of the ac current to flow through the
load, producing a pulsating dc current. A basic half-wave circuit is
shown in Fig. 6.2.
Full-wave rectifier The full-wave rectifier, shown in Fig. 6.3,
allows both halves of the ac current to flow through the load in the
same direction. This produces a pulsating dc with a frequency twice
that of the original ac waveform.
Rectification Rectification is defined as the process of converting
an ac current to a dc current. Rectifiers are basically forms of diodes,
either vacuum tubes or semiconductor devices.
Filter circuit The filter circuit in a power supply smooths out the ac
ripple in the rectified dc current, producing a relatively constant output
voltage across the load. Figure 6.4 shows several types of filter circuits.
Transformers Transformers are electromagnetic devices consisting of
two or more windings that are inductively coupled to transfer electrical

energy from one winding to the other(s). The transformer is used in most
ac-operated power supplies to perform two important functions. First, it
is used to step-up or step-down the ac line voltage to the required operating levels. The second function of the transformer is that of isolating the
power output circuit from the ac power line. This reduces or eliminates
the potential shock hazard involved in direct connection to the ac power
line. Figures 6.2 and 6.3 illustrate the use of power transformers.
Regulator circuit The purpose of the regulator circuit in a power supply is to maintain a constant output voltage under conditions of varying
input ac line voltage or output load resistance. In its simplest form, a regulator circuit might consist of a loading resistor permanently connected

across the output of the power supply. The resistor acts as a partial load,
which reduces the load/no-load voltage variations experienced with simple power supplies. Electronic voltage regulators, using vacuum tubes or
semiconductor devices, maintain a constant output voltage within specified limits of variations in the input ac power line voltage and output load
conditions. Semiconductor voltage regulators include zener diodes, transistors, or special integrated circuits designed for this purpose.
Ripple voltage Usually associated with the dc output of a rectifier
circuit, the ripple voltage is defined as the ac component inherent in
the dc output voltage. Filters are used to reduce or eliminate the ac ripple voltage.

Power-Supply Design Considerations
Power-supply design discussed in this section is based on the use of
semiconductor devices and relatively low output voltage requirements.
Information on vacuum-tube power supplies is available in the many
amateur radio publications, which can be obtained at libraries, newsstands, or electronic parts distributors. However, the principles involved
in either vacuum-tube or semiconductor power supplies are the same.

The power transformer
Power transformers are normally specified in terms of input and output voltages, and the current rating of the secondary winding. Typical 120-Vac, 60-Hz power transformers have secondary voltages of
6.3 Vac, 12.6 Vac, or 24 Vac. The secondary output voltages are listed
in terms of rms or effective ac volts. The rectified peak output voltage
is 1.414 times the rms value. Thus a 12.6-Vac rms voltage produces a
peak voltage of almost 18 Vdc when rectified. The ac and dc voltage
waveforms are illustrated in Fig. 6.5. Transformer secondary or output voltage requirements are based on the following factors: ac
power line variations, internal voltage drops of the power supply,
and the output load. Internal voltage drops include forward-bias
voltages across rectifiers, ac ripple voltages, and the regulator
dropout voltage, if applicable. These factors will be considered in the
final design criteria.
Secondary-winding current ratings are determined by any internal
power-supply current and the maximum load current anticipated for

the power supply. A good rule of thumb is to select a transformer that
provides at least 50% more secondary current than is required by the
anticipated load requirement. This will prevent overheating problems
and increase life expectancy of the power supply.

Rectifier circuits
Figures 6.2 and 6.3 illustrate the half-wave and full-wave rectifier circuits, respectively. The half-wave rectifier is rarely used in powersupply design due to the increased filtering required to reduce the ac
ripple voltage to acceptable levels.
THE FULL-WAVE RECTIFIER
The detailed analysis of the full-wave rectifier is given to illustrate the
operational characteristics of this circuit. Consider the circuit in Fig. 6.6.
A 24-Vac center-tapped transformer, T1, is used to provide 12 Vac to each
rectifier diode. Note that 12 Vac rms is approximately equal to a peak ac
voltage of about 17 volts. The peak ac values must be considered in any
power-supply design.

When the first half of the ac voltage waveform is impressed across
the secondary winding, point A becomes positive and allows diode D1
to conduct. Current flows in the circuit as shown by the solid arrows.
Because point B is negative during this interval, diode D2 is reversed
biased and does not conduct.
During the second half of the ac waveform, point B becomes positive and this causes diode D2 to conduct. Current flow in the circuit

due to D2 conducting is illustrated by the dashed arrows. Diode D1 is
reversed biased during this portion of the cycle and does not conduct.
The output voltage, VL, appearing across load resistor RL is also
illustrated in Fig. 6.6. The odd-numbered half cycles are related to current flow in diode D1 while the even-numbered half cycles are due to
current flow in diode D2.
The advantage of the full-wave rectifier lies in the fact that both
halves of the ac cycle are used, resulting in a ripple frequency of 120
Hz. The main disadvantage of the full-wave rectifier is that a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding and a higher output
voltage is required.
THE FULL-WAVE BRIDGE RECTIFIER
The limitations of the full-wave rectifier can be overcome by the bridge rectifier shown in Fig. 6.7. A description of the operation of the bridge
rectifier is given as follows. Diodes D2 and D4 conduct during the positive half of the ac cycle. This occurs when point A is positive and point
B is negative. Current flow during this interval is shown by the solid
arrows.

When the ac voltage across points A and B is reversed during the second half of the ac cycle, diodes D1 and D3 conduct. At the same time,
diodes D2 and D4 are reversed biased and are cut off. The resulting current flow is shown by the dashed arrows.
The bridge rectifier combines the best features of the half-wave and
full-wave rectifiers—the dc output voltage is approximately equal to
the secondary voltage and the ripple frequency is 120 Hz.
RECTIFIER VOLTAGE AND CURRENT RATINGS
Three characteristics of rectifiers must be considered in any power-supply
design. All are critical to the proper and efficient operation of the power
supply.

Peak inverse voltage (PIV) All rectifiers are rated in terms of peak
inverse voltage. This is defined as the maximum reverse voltage that
the rectifier can withstand during periods of nonconduction. The PIV
ratings of most rectifiers will range from about 50 to 1000 volts. Generally speaking, the PIV rating for a specific rectifier should be at least
twice the peak ac voltage output of the power transformer. Many
designers add an additional 50% to account for ac line voltage variations and transient voltage spikes.
Average rectified current (IO) Most rectifiers are rated in terms of the
maximum load current. When individual diodes are used to make up a
full-wave or bridge rectifier, the individual current rating of each diode
must be considered. In general, each diode in a full-wave or bridge recti-

Ch06_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:49 PM

Page 213

POWER SUPPLIES

fier circuit should have a minimum average current rating of one-half the
maximum load current. For maximum circuit reliability, the average current rating of each diode should equal that of the maximum load current.
Encapsulated or packaged rectifier assemblies are normally rated in
terms of maximum load current. It is recommended that the current
rating of the packaged rectifier assembly be about twice that of the
intended maximum load current.
Forward voltage drop (VF ) During conduction, the forward voltage
drop across a rectifier diode must be considered as an internal voltage drop
within the power supply. Silicon rectifiers will exhibit a forward voltage
drop of about 1 to 2 volts for each diode. The forward voltage drop for germanium diodes varies from about 0.5 to 1.0 volt. Because two diodes are
always conducting in a bridge rectifier circuit, the total forward voltage
drop for the rectifier circuit ranges from about 2 to 3 volts.
Rectifier and power-diode ratings are available in most semiconductor handbooks. In many instances, the ratings are printed on the
package or box containing the device. Careful attention should be paid
to these ratings when determining the correct specifications for the
internal circuit. Otherwise, using an improper rectifier in the power
supply will result in marginal performance or destruction of the rectifier. Table 6.1 provides a partial listing of typical rectifiers that are
widely available.

Filter circuits
We use filter circuits in power supplies to smooth out the varying dc
output from the rectifier. This pulsating dc voltage can cause hum and
other poor operational characteristics in electronic circuits such as
amplifiers.
The primary element in the filter circuit is the filter capacitor. Figure 6.8 illustrates the action of a filter capacitor during charging and
discharging cycles. First, consider the simple half-wave rectifier with
no filter capacitor. The rectified or pulsating dc voltage developed
across the load resistor, RL, rises to a maximum value, VP, during the
first half of each ac cycle. Then, this rectified voltage drops to zero and
remains at this level during the second half of each ac cycle. This varying dc voltage, shown in Fig. 6.8B, has the same frequency as the ac
input voltage.

Now add the filter capacitor, CF, to the circuit. For the first half of
the ac cycle, the increasing rectified dc voltage charges the capacitor,
storing electrical energy within the capacitor. When the rectified dc
voltage passes the peak value and starts to fall to zero, the charged
capacitor begins to discharge, providing current to the load resistor.
The diode prevents the capacitor from discharging current back into
the ac source.

If the capacitor has sufficient capacitance, i.e., many microfarads
for most filter capacitors, the discharge action will not be completed
before the next ac cycle begins. Thus, the next positive half cycle of ac
will produce a dc current flow that recharges the capacitor back to its
original value. This charge and discharge action, illustrated in Fig.
6.8C, occurs once for every ac cycle.
Although the filter capacitor prevents the dc voltage across RL from
dropping to zero, there remains a varying ac component in the dc voltage. This ac component is known as the ac ripple voltage. The frequency of the ac ripple voltage is the same as that of the ac power
source, normally 60 Hz for half-wave ac-operated power supplies. Figure 6.9 illustrates the ac ripple voltage contained in the rectified dc
voltage. The amplitude of the ac ripple voltage, defined as Vmax – Vmin,
depends primarily on two factors: the capacitance of the filter capacitor, C F, and the current flowing in the load resistor, R L. Increasing the
capacitance of C F reduces the ac ripple voltage. Conversely, an
increase in load current results in a higher ac ripple voltage. For halfwave rectifiers, the approximate ac ripple voltage contained in a simple, single-capacitor filter circuit is given as:

Full-wave and bridge rectifiers produce a rectified dc voltage with
an ac ripple frequency twice that of the ac power source. The ripple
frequency is normally 120 Hz for ac-operated power supplies using
full-wave rectifiers. The approximate amplitude of the ac ripple voltage for single-capacitor filter circuits used with full-wave or bridge
rectifiers is determined by:

(Eq. 6.2)

As in half-wave rectifier circuits, increasing the value of the filter
capacitor in full-wave rectifier circuits reduces the ac ripple voltage.
However, for the same value of filter capacitance, the ac ripple voltage
in full-wave and bridge rectifiers is approximately one-half that of
half-wave rectifiers.
In regulated solid-state power supplies, the filter circuit normally
consists of two capacitors. One capacitor, normally ranging from hundreds to thousands of microfarads, is used to reduce the ac ripple volt-

age to an acceptable level. The other capacitor, an RF bypass capacitor
of about 0.1 to 0.5 µF, is used to short out any transient voltage spikes,
which occasionally occur on the ac power line. The second capacitor
is required because large-capacitance electrolytic capacitors do not act
as capacitors at high frequencies.
The single-capacitor filter reduces the ac ripple voltage in low-voltage regulated power supplies to values from less than 1 volt to about 3
volts. The electronic regulator then takes over and reduces the ac ripple voltage to insignificant values.
Filter circuits for vacuum-tube and solid-state power supplies are
illustrated in Fig. 6.10. These circuits are used when electronic regulators are impractical or too expensive. The two-capacitor input circuits in Fig. 6.10A and B are known as pi filters, and each component,
capacitor, resistor, and inductor contributes to the filtering process.
The capacitors smooth out the ac ripple voltage and the resistor or
inductor provides opposition to the flow of ac ripple current. The RC
filter circuit in Fig. 6.10A also reduces the dc output voltage of the
power supply.
The choke input filter in Fig. 6.10C is used in power supplies where
the load variation is extensive. For example, the load presented by an
HF transceiver varies considerably from receive to transmit conditions.
Inductor L1 is a special choke designed to improve voltage regulation.
This inductor is referred to as a swinging choke; the inductance varies
with the load current. A disadvantage of the choke-input power supply
is that the dc output voltage is somewhat less than that of the capacitorinput type.

ZENER-FOLLOWER REGULATOR
The zener-follower regulator, shown in Fig. 6.12, is a series voltage regulator using a power transistor to control the dc output voltage. A zener
diode provides a stable reference voltage on the base of the power transistor, thereby maintaining a constant emitter voltage. The power transistor,
referred to as a series-pass transistor, is connected in a common-collector
or emitter-follower configuration.

The collector-emitter voltage, VCE, is equal to the input unregulated
voltage, VIN, minus the output regulated voltage, VOUT. Thus the power,
PD, that the pass transistor must be able to dissipate is:

(Eq. 6.3)

The output voltage, VOUT, is determined by the zener diode reference
voltage, VD, less the base-emitter junction voltage, VBE. This junction
voltage is approximately 0.3 volt for germanium transistors and 0.7
volt for silicon transistors. For example, if a dc output voltage of about
12 volts is required, a 13-volt zener diode is recommended.
The value of R1 is based on the power dissipation rating of the zener
diode and the required base current of the pass transistor for both fullload and no-load conditions.
A typical 12-Vdc, 1-ampere zener-follower regulated power supply
is shown in Fig. 6.13. This power supply is capable of powering amateur equipment with low current requirements such as receivers or
low-power QRP rigs. The output voltage can be changed by substituting

a different zener diode. For example, output voltages of approximately
5, 6, 9, 15, and 18 volts can be obtained with zener diodes rated at 6, 7,
10, 16, and 19 volts, respectively. If the lower voltages of 5 to 9 volts are
the maximum that will be required, a power transformer with a secondary rating of 12 Vac at 1.2 to 2 amperes can be substituted for the 18volt transformer.
The power supply in Fig. 6.13 can be constructed using point-topoint wiring, perforated board, or a “home-brew” printed-circuit
board, whichever is most convenient. The only critical item is an
appropriate heat sink for the power transistor. The heat sink can be
fabricated from a small aluminum bracket or obtained from a local
electronics parts supplier.
The zener-follower voltage regulator provides good regulation
characteristics with minimum ac ripple voltage for low to medium
load current. The disadvantages of this type of regulator are poor performance characteristics with high load current and lack of short-circuit protection. The power transistor can be destroyed if a short is
placed across the output terminals. Sometimes a damaged power transistor will

SERIES-PARALLEL VOLTAGE
REGULATORS

The series-parallel voltage regulator uses a
series-pass transistor controlled by a parallel-connected transistor that senses the
output voltage to provide automatic corrective action. Figure 6.14 illustrates this
type of regulator circuit. Transistor Q2 is a
dc amplifier controlled by a small portion
of the output voltage. A voltage-reference
or zener diode, VR1, maintains a constant
emitter voltage for Q2. Thus, the output

Ch06_Laster_136187-1

POWER SUPPLIES

voltage sampled at potentiometer R3 is used to control the base current
of the series-pass transistor, Q1. If the output voltage drops due to
loading effects or power-line variations, transistor Q2 raises the base
voltage of series-pass transistor Q1. This causes the voltage drop, VCE,
across the series-pass transistor to decrease and, therefore, raises the
load voltage back to the required level. Conversely, if the output voltage increases beyond its intended limit, transistor Q2 lowers the base
voltage on series-pass transistor Q1. This action increases the collector-emitter voltage across Q1 and thus reduces the output voltage to
the specified value.
The regulator output voltage is held constant by the base-emitter
voltage of Q2 and the very stable emitter voltage determined by the
zener diode, VR1. The zener voltage for VR1 is normally selected at
about 6 to 8 volts because this is an optimum value in terms of temperature stability.
Potentiometer R3 allows a wide control of the output voltage level.
This output voltage can be adjusted to a precise value, which remains
constant despite varying load conditions and power-line variations.
Fixed resistors R2 and R4 place safe limitations on the output voltage.
Both positive and negative series-parallel voltage regulators are
shown in Fig. 6.14. The primary differences are that pnp transistors
are used in the negative voltage regulator and the zener diode is
reversed. These voltage regulators provide excellent regulation characteristics and very low ripple-voltage content. However, like the
zener-follower regulator, the series-parallel regulator does not provide
for short-circuit protection. A fuse in the input circuit of these regulators will help to protect the pass transistor.
INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE REGULATORS
A significant advance in solid-state power supply technology is the development of complete voltage-regulator circuits on a single chip. These
three-terminal devices are available in a variety of voltage and current ratings. Table 6.2 lists some of the typical IC voltage regulators currently
available.

In addition to providing excellent voltage-regulation characteristics and extremely low ripple-voltage content, these regulators provide
short-circuit protection. The regulator automatically shuts down if a
short circuit is placed across the load terminals.

Figure 6.15 shows a basic power supply circuit for almost any
three-terminal IC voltage regulator. Any of the voltage regulators listed
in Table 6.2, except the 723C types, can be used in this circuit as long
as proper voltage ratings for the power transformer, bridge rectifier,
and filter capacitors are observed. Typical values for these components are given in Fig. 6.15 and Table 6.3. Be sure to install the voltage
regulator on an appropriate heat sink. Otherwise, extended operation
at high load current will cause excessive heat to build up in the regulator case and possibly damage the device.

120-Vac potential should be taped to prevent accidental contact. The
3-wire-type ac plugs should be used so that the power line ground can
be connected to any metal chassis or cabinet used to house the power
supply. All primary power wiring should be fused with a fast-blow
fuse to prevent damage to the equipment. Remember, the 120-Vac
power line can be lethal. Electric shock can also cause burns or other
injury to the inexperienced amateur operator. After the photograph in

emiconductor devices and vacuum tubes are used in electronic circuits to perform a variety of functions related to radio receivers and
transmitters. A typical amateur HF transceiver will contain up to ten
individual amplifiers and three to four oscillator circuits in addition to
modulators, demodulators, and other types of circuits. This chapter
covers the amplifier and oscillator, both in terms of theory and practical circuits. The remaining basic receiver and transmitter circuits are
covered in Chaps. 8 and 9.
The Technician Class license examination contains only a few
questions on electronic circuits. The additional material covered in
this chapter will help to increase your knowledge of electronic circuits
and help you to upgrade to a higher class of amateur radio license.

to 20-kHz range of the frequency spectrum. Audio amplifiers are normally operated in Class-A, -B, or -AB modes of operation.
Radio-frequency (RF) amplifier The RF amplifier is a device or
circuit designed to amplify radio-frequency signals of a specified frequency or band of frequencies. Radio-frequency amplifiers can be classified as either tuned or untuned, and can be operated in Class-A, -B,
-AB, or -C modes of operation.
Class-A amplifier The Class-A amplifier is operated in the linear
region of its characteristic curve and produces an output waveform
with the same shape as that of the input waveform. Current flows in
the output circuit at all times resulting in linear operation.
Class-B amplifier The Class-B amplifier employs two transistors
(or vacuum tubes) in a “push-pull” configuration. One transistor (or
tube) amplifies the positive one-half cycle of the input signal while
the other transistor (or tube) amplifies the negative one-half cycle.
The bias for the Class-B amplifier circuit is adjusted to approximately
the cut-off bias level; no current flows in the output circuit during the
absence of an input signal. With an applied input signal, output current flows for approximately one-half cycle in each transistor (or
tube). Push-pull Class-B amplifiers provide an output signal that is a
good replica of the input signal waveform as well as good operating
efficiency.
Class-AB amplifier This amplifier uses a push-pull circuit configuration, which combines the advantages of Class-A and Class-B amplifiers, namely good linearity and excellent efficiency. The bias for this
amplifier is adjusted so that output current flows for slightly more
than one-half of the input cycle.
Class-C amplifier The bias for a Class-C amplifier is adjusted so that
it exceeds the cutoff bias level. This allows the output current to flow
only during a short portion of the input cycle. The Class-C amplifier is
essentially nonlinear but provides maximum efficiency of operation.
Preamplifier A preamplifier is an amplifier designed primarily for
amplifying low-level or weak signals. The output of the preamplifier is
normally fed into a conventional amplifier or a long transmission line.
The preamplifier might include specific frequency-bandpass or equalization networks.
Resistance-capacitance (RC) coupled amplifier This describes a
method of coupling the output signal from one amplifier to the input

of a following amplifier. Figure 7.1 illustrates an RC-coupled amplifier circuit. The input signal is coupled to the base of Q1 by capacitor C1. This provides dc isolation from the input signal source.
Resistors R1 and R2 form a “self-bias” network that biases Q1 for
Class-A operation. The output signal voltage is developed across the
collector resistor R3. This output signal is coupled to the required
load by capacitor C2, which also serves as a dc blocking capacitor.
This prevents the dc supply voltage from being impressed on the
required load.
Transformer-coupled amplifier Transformers are used to couple
the output signal from one amplifier to the input of the next amplifier.
Figure 7.2 shows a two-stage transformer-coupled amplifier. Transformer T1 couples the input signal to transistor Q1 for amplification
and blocks any dc voltages from interacting between the input signal
source and the biasing network for Q1. Transformer T1 also acts as an
impedance-matching device, matching the input signal source impedance to the input impedance of Q1. Transformer T2 serves as an interstage-coupling network, matching the output impedance of Q1 to the

Oscillator An oscillator is an electronic device or circuit that generates a sinusoidal or nonsinusoidal ac waveform from a dc power
source. The oscillator consists of an amplifier with a positive feedback
loop from output to input. Frequency-determining components, such
as inductors, capacitors, resistors, or quartz crystals, are included in
the feedback network to establish the required frequency of oscillation.
Crystal The crystal used in oscillator circuits consists of a thin
wafer of quartz suspended between two metal plates. Acting as the
dielectric in a capacitor, the quartz vibrates when subjected to an
electric field. This vibration, in turn, produces an alternating voltage
across the metal plates. The frequency of this alternating voltage is
inversely proportional to the thickness of the crystal wafer. The frequency and amplitude characteristics of the ac voltage developed by
the crystal are extremely stable and make possible crystal-controlled
oscillators with precise frequency control.
Crystal oscillator This type of oscillator uses a quartz crystal element that determines the frequency of oscillation. Crystal-controlled
oscillators are used when an accurate and stable source of oscillation
is required. A crystal oscillator having only one crystal element pro-

duces a single frequency of oscillation. If multiple frequencies are
required, a switching circuit can be added to the oscillator so that the
required crystal element can be switched into the feedback network.
Crystal oscillators can also be operated at harmonics or multiples of
the fundamental frequency of the crystal element. Figure 7.3 shows a
typical crystal oscillator circuit.
Colpitts oscillator The Colpitts oscillator employs a series LC tuned
circuit with a capacitive voltage divider in the feedback loop. The frequency can be adjusted over a wide range by using variable inductor or
variable capacitors. The Colpitts oscillator is illustrated in Fig. 7.4.
Electron-coupled oscillator The electron-coupled oscillator, normally employing either a tetrode or pentrode tube, consists of a tuned
control-grid oscillator section coupled into the screen grid. The plate output is isolated from the oscillator section, thereby minimizing the effects
of loading on the plate. Figure 7.5 shows an electron-coupled oscillator.

with a tapped inductor in the feedback loop. One end of the tapped
inductor is connected to the amplifier input while the other end connects to the amplifier output circuit. The Hartley oscillator is illustrated in Fig. 7.6.
Tuned-plate tuned-grid oscillator The tuned-plate tuned-grid oscillator employs two separate LC tuned circuits, one in the grid circuit of
the amplifier tube and one in the plate circuit. Feedback from output to
input is accomplished by the internal plate-to-grid capacitance of the
tube. The tuned-grid tuned-plate oscillator is illustrated in Fig. 7.7.

Audio- and Radio-Frequency Amplifiers
One of the most important functions of transistors and tubes is that of
amplification. Signals on the order of a few microvolts can be amplified to levels of tens to hundreds of volts by the use of amplifiers.

Transmitters use RF amplifiers to boost low-level RF signals to high
levels. For example, RF amplifiers in Technician CW transmitters can
be used to boost output signal levels up to 250 watts if the maximum
authorized power is desired. Voice transmitters have audio amplifiers
to amplify the low-level audio signals produced by microphones to
levels required for modulation.

Basic Types of Amplifiers
Amplifiers are described in many different ways—voltage, current,
power, small-signal, large-signal, radio-frequency, Class-A (-B, -AB, orC), resistance-capacitance-coupled, transformer-coupled, and other
expressions intended to indicate operational characteristics. Amplifiers
can use vacuum tubes, bipolar junction transistors, field-effect transistors, or integrated circuits as the active amplifying elements. The term
amplifier can pertain to a single transistor, or it might describe a complete audio amplifier circuit consisting of many tubes, transistors, or a
single integrated circuit.

The ideal amplifier
The ideal amplifier is designed to amplify the input signal in terms of
voltage, current, or power. The input signal can be either dc or ac. Figure 7.8 shows two common symbols used for representing amplifiers.
Either type of symbol, triangle or rectangle, can be used to indicate a
voltage, current, or power amplifier. These symbols are used in block
diagrams and sometimes in schematic diagrams when integrated cir-

practical purposes, vacuum tubes and field-effect transistors exhibit
this characteristic since the input resistance of these devices is on the
order of many megohms.
Figure 7.8B shows a current amplifier, typical of bipolar junction
transistors. In the ideal current amplifier, both the input voltage, Vin,
and the input resistance are zero. The bipolar junction transistor
approaches these conditions—the input base-emitter voltage (for the
common-emitter configuration) is on the order of 0.7 volt and the
input resistance ranges from less than 100 ohms to about 1 k. The gain

The Decibel
This is an excellent time to introduce the concept of decibels. Many
technical articles, books, and equipment specifications refer to the

gain (or loss) rating of an amplifier, antenna, or other type of electronic
equipment in terms of decibels.
The expression of gain (or loss) in terms of input and output quantities is sometimes awkward or inconvenient. Calculations involving
several amplifier stages or other related circuits become complex
when using amplification factors. The use of decibels simplifies many
of these calculations.
Decibels primarily express a power-change ratio in logarithmic
terms. The decibel rating for an electronic device such as an amplifier
or antenna indicates the gain (or loss) of electrical energy from input to
output. This relationship is:
dB  10 log

Pout
Pin

(Eq. 7.5)

where
dB is gain (or loss) in decibels
Pout is the signal output power in watts
Pin is the signal input power in watts
Because decibels represent a logarithmic dc ratio of two levels, the
gain (or loss) of several circuits connected in cascade is equal to the
algebraic sum of their decibel ratings. Figure 7.9 illustrates two amplifiers and a filter network connected in cascade for amplifying a given
signal. The bandpass filter has a loss of 3 dB. The total gain of this circuit or related types of circuits is given by:

The following two examples illustrate
use of Equations 7.5 and 7.6.
Example 1 The amplifier in Fig. 7.10 produces 12.5 watts of output

power when driven by an input signal with a power level of 0.75 watt.
Express this power amplification in decibels.
Solution

Step 1. Use Equation 7.5 to set up the initial step for this problem.
Step 2. Table 7.1 discusses the alternate methods that may be used to
solve for logarithms. The logarithm of 16.67 is found to be 1.22. Completing the equation in Step 1, the power gain in decibels is calculated:
dB  10 log 16.67  10 × 1.22  12.2 dB (Answer).
Example 2 Two RF amplifiers, a transmission line, and an antenna are

connected as shown in Fig. 7.11. With the indicated gain (or loss) in decibels for each component, what is the overall gain of this circuit? If 2
watts of RF power is fed into the initial amplifier, what is the RF power
radiated by the antenna?
Solution

Step 1. The gain or loss of each section of the circuit can be added algebraically to determine the total gain (or loss) of the total circuit. If quantities are added algebraically, the positive values are all added together
and the negative values are subtracted from this total. Therefore,
Total GaindB  6

3 – 2  17 dB (Answer).

Note that the total gain does not have to be equal to a positive number.
For example, if the loss in the transmission line was equal to –20 dB, the
total circuit loss would be:

Voltage and Current Ratios in Decibels
Voltage and current amplification ratios can be expressed in decibels
when appropriate. However, these calculations might be meaningless

if input and output impedances are not identified. For the special case
of Zin  Zout (input impedance equal to output impedance), the actual
values of the impedances are not necessary when expressing voltage or

Table 7.1 gives the logarithms for the powers of ten and their relationship to the exponents. A simple two-place logarithmic table is also
included. The Technician Class examination will probably not
include any questions on decibels or logarithms. However, almost all
experienced hams will discuss antenna gain or related measurements
in terms of decibels. You will find this concept a handy tool to be used
in your amateur radio hobby.

Characteristic

Mantissa

Note that the characteristic for numbers above 100 is always equal to
the value of the exponent, or one less than the number of decimal digits. An alternate way to express 2000 is 2.0 × 103. The logarithm of this
number can be expressed as:

Page 242

242 CHAPTER SEVEN
log (2000)  log (2.0 × 103)  log 2.0

log 103

From Table 7.1, the log of 2 is 0.3 and the log of 103 is 3.0. Adding these
two numbers provides the log of 2000 as being 0.3 + 3.0 or 3.30. In this
manner, you can solve for the logarithm of any number to about two
decimal places. For two-place numbers, such as 15 or 35, you can
extrapolate between the given numbers. For example, the log of 15 is
approximately halfway between the log of 10 and the log of 20. Solving this example with the aid of Table 7.1 is given as follows:
Log 10  log (1 × 101)  log 1
 0.00 1  1.00
Log 20  log (2 × 101)  log 2
 0.30 1  1.30

log 101
log 101

The log of 15 is approximately one-half way between the values of 1.00
and 1.30, or 1.15 (Answer). Solving this problem with a pocket calculator provides an answer of 1.1761. The error in using the simplified
approach is (1.1761 – 1.15)/1.1761, or about 2 percent.
The scientific pocket calculator provides an excellent means for
solving problems in decibels and logarithms. An alternate approach is
to obtain an inexpensive mechanical slide rule. Either device will help
you to sharpen your ability in solving electronics problems. They usually come with detailed instructions that will help you learn some
mathematical fundamentals.

Amplifier Power Levels
Amplifiers are normally designed to operate within specified input and
output signal levels. These levels are expressed in terms of voltage, current, or power, depending on the type of amplifier circuit and active element (transistor or vacuum tube) used in the circuit. In this manner, the
amplifier design can be optimized for maximum desired performance.
The small-signal amplifier is designed to amplify low-level signals in
the microvolt to millivolt range. These amplifiers must possess low
internal noise so that the low-level signals will not be masked. Design
engineers refer to this characteristic in terms of a usable signal-to-noise
ratio. In most cases, the amplifier linearity and gain stability characteristics are carefully controlled to permit a wide variation of input signal
levels. Small-signal transistors or receiving type vacuum tubes, with

Ch07_Laster_136187-1

Page 243

ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS

output load currents of a few milliamperes,
are normally used as the active amplifying
devices in small-signal amplifiers. The
small-signal amplifier is used primarily to
boost low-level signals to suitable amplitudes for input to power amplifiers or other
related circuits. The small-signal amplifier
is rarely designed to produce output power
levels over one-half watt.
Power amplifiers are designed to
deliver large power levels to the intended
load. Audio output amplifiers and transmitter final amplifiers are typical examples of power amplifiers. Generally
speaking, any amplifier capable of producing an output power of one watt or more is
classified as a power amplifier.
Both small-signal and power amplifiers
are used for audio and high-frequency
amplification requirements in receivers and
transmitters. Most high-frequency amplifiers used for such functions as intermediate- or radio-frequency (IF or RF) stages
have frequency-sensitive networks to shape
the frequency response of the amplifier in
terms of single-frequency or bandpass operation. Sometimes untuned high-frequency
amplifiers are used in receivers or transmitters for special-function stages.

Class-A, -B, -AB, and -C Amplifiers
Classification of amplifiers in these terms describes the relationship
between the input-signal waveform and the output-signal or load-current
flow. This relationship is established by the biasing network and the
input-signal amplitude. Figure 7.12 illustrates these four basic classes of
amplifier operation along with a summary of the basic characteristics for
each class. Any of the previously described amplifiers (audio/high-fre-

quency or small-signal/power) can be operated in Class-A, -B, -AB, or -C
modes of operation.
Class-A operation produces a linear output—the output-signal waveform is equal in shape to that of the input signal. The output current
flows for the full 360 degrees of each cycle of the ac input waveform.
The efficiency of operation ranges from about 15 to 25 percent. In ClassB operation, the output current flows for only 180 degrees due to the
biasing network. No current flows during the second half of the ac
input-signal cycle. This increases the efficiency of operation up to about
65 percent. The biasing network in a Class-AB amplifier allows a small
output current to flow in the absence of an input signal. The output-signal current flows for more than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.
The efficiency of operation is approximately equal to that of the Class-B
amplifier. The Class-C amplifier is biased beyond cutoff and allows the
load current to flow for only a portion of the time between 0 and 180
degrees. Efficiency of operation ranges up to 80 percent.
Class-A operation is used primarily for small-signal or power
amplifiers using a single amplifier device (tube or transistor). Class-B
and -AB amplifiers are normally used in a push-pull configuration for
power amplification in audio and high-frequency operation. Class-C
amplifiers are used almost exclusively for high-frequency amplification such as in RF amplifiers.

Amplifier Efficiency of Operation
Efficiency of operation for amplifiers is defined as the ratio of useful
power developed by the amplifier and the dc power required to operate the amplifier, or:

Note that efficiency of operation is always specified in percentage. For
vacuum tubes, efficiency of operation is defined as plate efficiency
and the dc input power is simply plate voltage times plate current. An
example is given to illustrate Equation 7.9.
Example A vacuum-tube RF amplifier delivers 50 watts of power when
the plate voltage is 400 Vdc and the plate current is 200 mA. What is the
plate efficiency of this amplifier?

Interstage Coupling Techniques
When large amounts of gain are required for specified applications, two
or more amplifiers can be connected in a cascade configuration. Figure
7.13 shows a basic cascade amplifier consisting of three individual
amplifier stages and two coupling networks.
Four basic types of coupling circuits are used in amateur radio equipment. All of these coupling techniques can be used with both audio and
high-frequency amplifiers. Many amateur HF SSB transceivers use all
four types of coupling in audio, IF, or RF amplifier circuits.

Direct coupling
As implied, the output signal from one stage is directly coupled to the
input of the next stage. Figure 7.14A shows a two-stage, direct-coupled transistor amplifier. This type of coupling provides a wide frequency response and is used in dc amplifiers as well as ac or signal
amplifiers. Note that the biasing of Q2 depends on the dc voltage level
at the collector Q.

ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS

Resistance-capacitance (RC) coupling
Probably the most widely used type of coupling in both vacuum-tube
and transistor audio amplifier circuits, this type of coupling isolates
the dc supply from each stage. This permits the use of individual bias
networks and allows replacement of defective tubes or transistors
without having to readjust the bias network for proper operation. Figure 7.14B shows a two-stage transistor audio amplifier using RC coupling. Coupling capacitor CC allows the ac signal to flow from the
output of Q1 to the input of Q2, but blocks the dc supply voltage. The
primary disadvantage of this inexpensive type of coupling is an inherent loss of gain when coupling between unequal impedances. For
example, coupling the high-impedance output of one common-emitter
transistor stage into the low-impedance input of a similar following
stage results in a loss of gain.

Transformer coupling
The transformer-coupled amplifier, illustrated in Fig. 7.14C, provides
maximum gain because the transformer acts as an impedance-matching device. However, transformer coupling is limited in frequency
response and the transformer usually represents a high-cost item.
Transformers are usually used in IF and RF amplifier circuits where a
specific frequency response is required and gain is important. The
transformers also provide dc isolation between stages. In other words,
the dc voltage level at the output of one stage will not affect the input
of the next stage. Transistors Q1 and Q2 in Fig. 7.14C are n-channel
JFETs with source resistor biasing.

Impedance coupling
This type of coupling, shown in Fig. 7.14D, combines the frequencyresponse characteristics of the transformer and the simplicity of the
RC-coupling technique. Impedance coupling is used in IF and RF
amplifiers where limited frequency response is required.
Transistor Q1 and Q2 in Fig. 7.14D are n-channel JFETs with
source resistor biasing. Capacitor C1 and coil L1 form the input circuit of the signal source. Tank circuit L2C2 is a tuned network, which
is normally resonant at the signal frequency. Coupling capacitor C3
provides dc isolation between Q1 and Q2. Tank circuit L3C4 is also

247

Ch07_Laster_136187-1

12:50 PM

Page 248

248 CHAPTER SEVEN
normally resonant at the signal frequency. Capacitor C5 is an output
coupling capacitor to the intended load. Note that each tank circuit
employs a variable capacitor for tuning to the required resonant frequency. Many high-frequency circuits in both receivers and transmitters use this type of coupling between stages.

Push-Pull Operation
Single Class-B and -AB amplifiers, sometimes referred to as singleended amplifiers, cannot be used for linear amplification due to the distorted output characteristics. The push-pull configuration eliminates
this distortion by amplifying each half of the input signal with separate
dedicated amplifier sections. One section amplifies the positive half
and the other section amplifies the negative half. Class-B and -AB pushpull amplifiers provide good linearity and efficiency of operation. ClassC push-pull amplifiers provide even better efficiency of operation but
they are nonlinear. Class-B and -AB amplifiers are used as high-level
audio modulators in amplitude-modulated (am) transmitters and as linear RF amplifiers in single-sideband (SSB) transmitters. The Class-C
amplifier is often used in a push-pull configuration for developing large
amounts of radio-frequency power in audio-modulated (am) and continuous-wave (CW) transmitters. Additional information concerning the
operation of radio-frequency amplifiers is provided in Chap. 8.
Figure 7.15 shows the basic circuit for a Class-B push-pull audio
amplifier. Class-AB operation can be obtained by adding the appropriate
biasing network to the base of each transistor. Transformer T1 couples
the input signal to the base of each transistor in the proper phase. Note
that the positive half of the input signal appears as a positive signal at the
base of transistor Q1 and the negative half of the input signal appears as
a positive signal at the base of transistor Q2. Thus, the first half of the
input signal drives Q1 and the second half of the signal drives Q2 in an
alternating or push-pull operation. Transistor Q2 does not conduct during the first half of the input signal while transistor Q1 does not conduct
during the second half of the input signal. The ac signal waveforms are
indicated for each transistor—the solid curved lines represent the amplified output of each amplifier section and the dotted curved lines show
the periods of nonconduction. Transformer T2 combines both halves of
the amplified signals from transistors Q1 and Q2, producing a complete,

A popular audio push-pull amplifier, made possible by low-impedance transistors, is the complementary-symmetry amplifier illustrated
in Fig. 7.16. This configuration eliminates the need for transformers
and the low-impedance output can drive loudspeakers or other lowimpedance loads on a direct basis. Matched npn and pnp transistors
are required for this amplifier circuit. Note that biasing for this type of
circuit is critical.

Integrated-Circuit Amplifiers
Integrated-circuit (IC) amplifiers are being used in increasing numbers
in all forms of electronic equipment. Specific amplifiers are available
for many applications including audio and high-frequency devices.

An IC Audio Amplifier for the Ham Shack
A complete audio amplifier for the ham shack, using the 386 integrated-circuit device, can be assembled in a minimum of time. This
amplifier can be powered by a single 9-volt battery or, if desired, an ac
power supply can be incorporated in the circuit for 120-Vac operation. Figure 7.18 shows the amplifier circuit and the optional power
supply is shown in Fig. 7.18B. A photograph of the amplifier using
the 386 IC is shown in Fig. 7.19.
The amplifier and optional ac power supply can be assembled on
perforated board or on a “home-brew” printed-circuit board. If a perforated board is used, the audio-amplifier integrated circuit can be
mounted in an IC socket. Safety precautions should be observed when
assembling and testing the optional ac power supply. All exposed terminals at ac line-voltage potential should be covered with electrical
tape. Be sure to use the grounding pin of the 3-wire ac plug. The other
end of the ground wire should be connected to the chassis or cabinet
of the power supply.

The switch shown in the upper-right of Fig. 7.18 is used to control
the gain of the amplifier. It can be set to provide a gain of 20 or 200.
Note that a power switch is required for permanent installation. The
switch on the volume control (upper-left) can be used for this purpose.
This amplifier can be used to amplify the output from QRP rigs to
power a loudspeaker. The amplifier can also be used as a signal tracer
for servicing ham receivers, particularly the audio stages. If desired, an
RF probe can be constructed that allows signal tracing in the RF or IF
stages of a receiver. A recommended circuit for the RF probe is given in

When signal tracing in RF circuits, connect

the circuit. You can then use the probe to
follow an RF signal through the receiver

receivers and transmitters, is simply an
amplifier with a feedback network connected between the output and
input terminals. The amplifier can be operated in a manner similar to
that of Class-A, Class-B, or Class-C amplifier characteristics.
The function of an oscillator is to generate an ac signal having a specified frequency and waveform. Most oscillators in radio communications
equipment generate a sinusoidal or sine waveform. Oscillators can be
designed to operate at frequencies ranging from subaudio (less than 20
Hz) to the top end of the radio frequency spectrum. Oscillators employ
transistors or tubes as the active amplifying devices.

254 CHAPTER SEVEN
The Basic Oscillator Circuit
Any oscillator can be reduced to three basic elements—an amplifier, a
frequency-determining feedback network, and a source of dc power. A
block diagram for the basic oscillator circuit is given in Fig. 7.21.
The amplifier section, either a vacuum tube or a transistor, provides sufficient gain to permit sustained oscillation. This means that
the ac output signal from the amplifier compensates for the losses in
the feedback network and provides a suitable input signal to the input
terminals of the amplifier. The amplifier can be operated in the ClassA, -B, or -C modes of operation.
The feedback network contains inductive, capacitive, or resistive
elements—or a combination of these elements—for determining the
frequency. In crystal oscillators, the crystal element acts as a high-Q LC
tuned circuit. The feedback network, in conjunction with the amplifier,
must satisfy two basic requirements for sustained oscillations:
■ An ac energy from the output terminals must be fed back to the

input terminals in the correct phase. Otherwise, the feedback
signal would cancel any ac input voltage and oscillation would
not occur. This in-phase feedback is called positive or regenerative feedback.

ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS
■ The amplitude of the feedback energy must be sufficient to over-

come losses in the feedback network. The gain of the amplifier
must be adjusted to provide this additional energy.
For optimum performance, the oscillator requires a well-filtered
and stable source of dc power. For example, if the dc power contains
an excess amount of 60- or 120-Hz ac power (from half-wave or fullwave rectifiers), this ac ripple signal will modulate the output signal of
the oscillator. Such an effect is readily noticeable on CW and radiotelephone transmissions.

Oscillator Characteristics
Oscillators used in radio communications equipment must possess
adequate frequency stability and constant amplitude characteristics.
The radio-frequency oscillators used in amateur HF transmitters and
receivers are designed for frequency stabilities on the order of 100 Hz
or less for carrier frequencies up to about 30 MHz. This is equal to
about one part in 300,000 or variations of less than 0.00033 percent. In
many instances, crystal-controlled oscillators are employed to achieve
this extreme stability.
Oscillator amplitude stability, the ability of an oscillator to provide a constant-amplitude output waveform, is important in both
transmitters and receivers. The performance of other circuits within
this equipment depends on the stability of oscillator amplitude and
frequency.

The Tuned LC Oscillator
Many high-frequency oscillators that operate at frequencies above 20
kHz employ tuned circuits consisting of inductors and capacitors.
When connected in a parallel configuration, the LC circuit has a natural resonant frequency determined by:

π is 3.1416
Figure 7.22A shows an ideal LC tuned circuit that has no resistance
in the inductor or in the interconnecting wiring. However, all inductors and associated wiring have some inherent resistance that dissipates the energy in the LC circuit.
When electrical energy is supplied to the ideal parallel LC tank circuit, current alternately flows between the inductor and capacitor at a
rate corresponding to the resonant frequency given in Equation 7.10.
For example, if the capacitor is initially charged, it discharges into the
inductor. The resulting current flow through the inductor generates a
magnetic field. As the current drops to zero, the magnetic field starts to
collapse on itself. The electrical energy stored in the magnetic field generates a voltage that is equal but opposite in polarity to the original voltage impressed across the capacitor. This
voltage charges the capacitor. When fully
charged, the capacitor again starts to discharge back into the inductor, starting a

second cycle of operation.
In the ideal LC tank circuit, these oscillations would occur indefinitely and would
produce a constant-amplitude waveform.

Figure 7.22B illustrates the voltage waveform from an ideal LC tank circuit. However, a finite amount of resistance exists in
any LC tank circuit. This resistance absorbs
power and causes the oscillations to eventually drop to a zero amplitude. This effect is

known as damped-wave oscillations and is
shown in Fig. 7.22C.
In addition to ohmic losses in the LC
tank circuit, the oscillator must furnish RF
power to other circuits within radio comC

Oscillator Circuits
There are many types of oscillators that have been developed for specific applications. Let’s look at several basic types used in amateur
radio equipment.
THE HARTLEY OSCILLATOR

One of the earliest oscillators used in radio com-munications equipment, the Hartley oscillator employs a resonant LC tank circuit in the
feedback network. Figure 7.23 shows a basic Hartley oscillator circuit
using an npn transistor in the amplifier section. Feedback is accomplished by the use of a tapped inductor which provides inductive coupling from the output end of the inductor to the input end. The output
end of the inductor is connected to the collector terminal of Q1 via the
dc-blocking capacitor, C3. The other end of the inductor provides an
input signal to Q1 via dc-blocking capacitor C2. The oscillator frequency is determined primarily by the L1C1 tank circuit. Capacitor C4
couples the output signal to the intended load.
Variable capacitor C1 allows the oscillator frequency to be varied
within specific limits. Oscillator circuits can be designed for a two-toone or a three-to-one change in oscillator frequency. For example, one
oscillator might be designed for a 3- to 6-MHz frequency range while
another design might call for a 3- to 9-MHz range.
Resistors R1 and R2 form a voltage-divider bias network for developing base bias for Q1. This bias can be adjusted for operation similar to
that of Class-A, -B, or -C amplifiers. Class-A type of operation results in
good waveform purity and the output signal is relatively free of harmonic content. This type of oscillator is
used for the local oscillator in receivers or
for the master oscillator in transmitters.

A more accurate determination of the frequency of oscillation would
include the effects of the internal capacitances of the transistor and
stray capacitances and inductances in the circuit.
Capacitor C3 couples a portion of the ac output signal back to the
L1C1C2 tank circuit in the proper phase and amplitude. The voltage
appearing across C1 as a result of this feedback action is fed to the base
of Q1. This causes a second cycle of the ac signal to be amplified by
Q1. The base bias for Q1 is established by resistors R1 and R2 for operation similar to Class-A, -B, or -C amplifiers. Capacitor C4 couples the
ac output signal to the intended load.
The modified Colpitts oscillator shown in Fig. 7.25, sometimes
referred to as the Clapp oscillator, uses a series tuned LC circuit. This
arrangement allows the use of a single variable capacitor for changing
the oscillator frequency. Capacitors C2 and C3 are large in comparison

where a stable, variable source of highfrequency energy is required. Colpitts oscillators can be designed to
operate as frequencies ranging from subaudio to the RF range of the frequency spectrum.
QUARTZ-CRYSTAL OSCILLATORS

Oscillators that employ quartz crystals as the frequency-determining
element exhibit a high degree of frequency stability. Many types of
crystal oscillator circuits, using transistors or vacuum tubes, have been
developed for specific applications. Some of the most popular crystal
oscillator circuits are the Colpitts, Pierce, and Miller. These circuits
are generally used for fundamental frequencies up to about 20 MHz
and overtone or harmonic frequencies up to about 200 MHz. To
achieve higher frequencies in the VHF and UHF spectrum, frequencymultiplying amplifiers are used ahead of the crystal oscillator.
The ideal frequency stability of conventional crystal oscillators is
about one part in one million, i.e., the oscillator frequency will not vary
more than 1 Hz in 1 MHz. However, crystal aging, changing temperature, and varying dc supply voltages will reduce this stability to about
one part in one hundred thousand (or about 10 Hz in 1 MHz). This
degree of stability is adequate for most amateur radio applications.
Because varying temperature accounts for most of the frequency
variations in a crystal-controlled oscillator, the crystal element can
be enclosed in a temperature-controlled oven. Most of the frequency

Ch07_Laster_136187-1

12:50 PM

Page 260

260 CHAPTER SEVEN
variations can be eliminated by maintaining a constant temperature
within one degree centigrade. Some precision crystal oscillators
used in a laboratory environment feature temperature control within
0.1 degree centigrade or less. Frequency stabilities of these precision
oscillators will approach one part in one billion or better.
Quartz crystals. Small wafers or slabs cut from a block of quartz crystal act as resonant tuned LC circuits. When used in the feedback networks of oscillators, these crystals generate a stable single frequency of
oscillation. The physical layout of a typical oscillator crystal and its
equivalent electrical circuit are given in Fig. 7.26.
Crystals exhibit extremely high values of Q (up to 10,000) and also
exhibit stable resonant-frequency characteristics. Each crystal oscillates at a fundamental frequency or at specified overtone frequencies.
If different frequencies are required from the same oscillator, a separate crystal for each frequency and a switching circuit is required.

ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS

The frequency of oscillation depends primarily on the thickness of
the crystal wafer. The capacitance of the crystal holder and the associated oscillator circuit will cause the frequency of oscillation to vary
slightly. Standard crystal oscillator circuits have been established to
maintain an identical frequency when installing a replacement crystal
in the circuit. Also, trimmer capacitors are sometimes included in the
oscillator circuit to adjust the frequency precisely to the required
value.
In the equivalent electrical circuit shown in Fig. 7.26B, capacitance
CG is the effective series capacitance caused by the air gap when the
metal plates are not touching the crystal wafer. This capacitance is not
considered in some analyses of crystals. Capacitance CM is the capacitance of the crystal holder and must be considered in the circuit design
of crystal oscillators. Elements R, L, and C represent the inherent electrical equivalent of the mechanical oscillating characteristics of the
crystal wafer. The value of CM is much greater than that of crystal
capacitance C by a factor of up to 100.
How crystals work. Crystal operation is based on the piezoelectric
effect. When physically stressed, the crystal generates a voltage that is
proportional to the amplitude and frequency of the physical force. An
example of a device using this principle is the crystal microphone found
in some amateur transmitters. Sound waves striking a diaphragm in the
microphone cause it to vibrate. These vibrations are applied to a crystal
element that, in turn, generates an ac voltage proportional to the
amplitude and frequency of the sound waves. The reverse condition,
placing an ac voltage across the crystal wafer, results in electromechanical vibrations or oscillations. The ac voltage generated by the
crystal can be used to drive the oscillator at the required frequency.
Many crystal materials found in nature or produced by commercial
processes, exhibit the piezoelectric effect. Three such materials,
Rochelle salts, tourmaline, and quartz, are used in electronics applications. Rochelle salts produce the highest piezoelectric activity, i.e., the
highest ac voltage for a given mechanical stress force. However, this
material is not suitable for crystal oscillator circuits due to poor temperature, humidity, and mechanical characteristics. Rochelle salts
crystal elements are used primarily in phonograph cartridges, microphones, and headsets.

Both tourmaline and quartz crystals
possess excellent operational characteristics for crystal oscillator circuits. Although
tourmaline shows a lower piezoelectric
activity than quartz, crystals made from
this material will oscillate at frequencies
up to about 100 MHz. Tourmaline, a semiprecious material, is rarely used in crystal
oscillators due to the high cost involved.
Quartz crystals are used almost exclusively in crystal oscillator circuits. Quartz
crystals are also used in filter circuits at RF
or IF frequencies. This application is discussed in Chap. 9.

wafers are cut from a block of quartz

illustrated in Fig. 7.27A. For reference
purposes, the crystal is assigned X, Y,
and Z axes. The Z or optical axis extends from top to bottom. The X
and Y axes, both at right angles to the Z axis, describe the orientation
of the hexagonal plane. The X axes pass through the hexagonal
points and the Y axes are perpendicular to the faces of the crystal.
Figure 7.27B shows a top view of the crystal and the orientation of
the X and Y axes.
Crystal wafers or elements are cut in many planes along the Z
axis or at various angles with respect to the Z axis. Each family of
cuts exhibits a particular set of operational characteristics in terms
of piezoelectric activity (or ease of oscillation), temperature effects
on frequency stability, and other factors. Some of the more common
cuts, the X cut, the Y cut, and the AT cut, are illustrated in Fig.
7.27C. For example, the X cut, which was developed in the late
nineteenth century, possesses high piezoelectric activity but is sensitive to changes in temperature. The frequency range of the X cut is

Ch07_Laster_136187-1

Page 263

ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS

approximately 40 to 350 kHz. The AT cut, on the other hand, possesses a low level of piezoelectric activity but exhibits excellent
operational characteristics in terms of frequency stability with
changing temperature and frequency of oscillation up to about 200
MHz. The AT-cut crystal is widely used in amateur and other radio
communication equipment.
Crystals are available with fundamental or overtone frequencies ranging from less than 4 kHz to over 200 MHz. Many military and commercial specifications have been developed to assure precise manufacture
and assembly of these devices. Crystals produced for the military and
other government agencies normally are covered by the CR-XX/U designators. CR stands for crystal resonator, and XX indicates the number or
letters assigned to a specific series of crystals. For example, the CR-5A/U
designator refers to a family of crystals with a frequency range of 2 to 10
MHz. Many commercial crystals can be referenced to an equivalent of
the government CR-XX/U designators.
Crystal elements are mounted or installed in a variety of holders.
The holders are designed for installing the crystal in special crystal
sockets or for direct soldering in printed-circuit boards. Again, almost
all types of crystal holders are covered by government specifications
bearing an FT-XXX or HC-XX/U designator. Outlines of some of the
more popular crystal holders are shown in Fig. 7.28. In some
instances, the type of holder indicates the range of frequencies available. For example, the HC-6/U holder might contain crystals with frequencies from 200 kHz to over 200 MHz.
The frequency of oscillation is normally stamped or marked on
commercial crystals and many crystals produced for the government.
However, some government crystals can be marked in terms of channel numbers. Because these channel numbers generally apply to a particular radio set, it is difficult to equate channel numbers with specific
frequencies. Watch for this limitation if you plan to purchase surplus
crystals or “rocks.” Some typical crystals used in amateur radio equipment are shown in Fig. 7.29.
The frequency tolerance for most crystals will usually be specified in
the range of 0.0005 to 0.02 percent. Tolerances for amateur crystals are
normally specified from 0.002 to 0.005 percent in order to reduce the
costs. Many crystal oscillator circuits include a trimmer capacitor for
“zeroing-in” the crystal frequency to the required frequency.

operating frequencies.
The ac feedback circuit consists of the capacitive voltage
divider, C2 and C3, and the crystal element. A portion of the ac signal developed at the collector of Q1 provides regenerative feedback
to the emitter. The amplitude of this ac feedback signal is determined by the ratio of C2 and C3. The resonant-frequency characteristics of the crystal controls the frequency of the ac signal

Introduction to Radio
Transmitters

he radio transmitter, one of the basic pieces of equipment in the
amateur radio station, generates signals at frequencies in the amateur bands. When coupled to a transmission line and antenna, this
energy produces electromagnetic radiation, or “radio waves.” Transmitters may be simple or complex, single band or multiband, and have
a variety of modulation schemes [continuous wave (CW), amplitude
modulation, single sideband, frequency modulation, or a combination
thereof].
Radio transmitters, as well as radio receivers, are generally classified in terms of the frequency bands they cover. For example, a transmitter designed to operate in the HF band, 3 to 30 MHz, requires
design and construction techniques that are generally different than
those used in VHF and UHF frequency bands. As a rule, construction
of HF transmitters and receivers are easy when compared to those
operating in the VHF and higher bands. The reason for this is that the
size of components and length of interconnecting conductors become
smaller as the radio frequency of operation increases. Finally, at
microwave frequencies, the size of components and interconnecting
wires is so small that special construction techniques are required. In
general, the beginning amateur operator can learn to construct and
operate simple HF transmitters and receivers. Fortunately, these simple radios can operate in the popular CW HF bands in the QRP, or

low-power mode. Many amateurs employ low-power rigs (5 watts or
lower) to make long-range contacts over thousands of miles.
Radio transmitters suitable for Technician Class operation in HF
bands may range from simple, low-power, crystal-controlled rigs to the
more elaborate transceivers. Power outputs of low-power transmitters
will vary from less than 1 watt to about 10 watts while the high-power
transceivers range from about 50 to 300 watts. Older types of equipment employ vacuum tubes or a combination of tubes and transistors
to perform the functions of oscillation, amplification, and modulation.
Most new amateur radios are fully solid-state and are generally
designed for 12-V dc operation.
You have a number of options for “getting on the air.” Many designs
for simple “home-brew” CW/phone transmitters and receivers are
available in amateur publications, such as handbooks and magazines.
Transmitters and transceivers, many in kit form, are available from
amateur radio suppliers. The Ramsey Model QRP-40 40-Meter Transmitter, shown in Fig. 8.1, is available in kit form for easy construction.
Building this kit can provide good experience. Figure 8.2 shows a simple, easy-tobuild HF receiver kit that covers the
80-meter, 40-meter, 30-meter and WWV,
20-meter, and 15-meter bands. After you
finish this type of kit, you may want to
investigate transceiver kits for other amateur bands on HF and VHF bands. With
these simple “home-brew” radios at a low
investment, you can get on the air with
either HF Morse code or 2-meter FM communications capability.

most amateur radio clubs will be glad to help you with technical problems or loan you an instruction manual or schematic for the used
equipment. Also, most amateur radio journals carry advertisements
listing used amateur radio equipment. Many of the companies
involved will check out and repair all used equipment before it is
offered for sale.
Another option for assembling your amateur radio station is the
purchase of new equipment. Many excellent HF transceivers are available from such companies as Kenwood USA, ICOM, MFJ Enterprises,
Ten-Tec, Yaesu, and others. Most of the equipment produced by these
companies is capable of single-sideband operation as well as CW—this
is a vital factor when the Technician upgrades to General or higher
class license.

equipment for operation above 50 MHz. Many VHF and UHF radios

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO TRANSMITTERS

Band-pass filter A circuit that passes a signal band of frequencies
and blocks signals with frequencies below and above the band-pass
limits.
Continuous-wave modulation Referred to as CW modulation, this
type of radio transmission conveys information by keying the carrier
wave on and off. Thus, the keyed dits and dahs are used to form characters of the International Morse code set. Sometimes CW modulation
is called radiotelegraphy, a term left over from the early days of radio.
Crystal oscillator An RF oscillator that uses a piezoelectric crystal to control the frequency of the oscillator within very accurate limits. See Chap. 7 for more details.
CW CW, or continuous wave, is the name for emissions produced
by switching a transmitter’s output on and off.
Detector A circuit (or stage) in a receiver that detects the audio
modulating component of an RF modulated signal. A detector is found
in every receiver.
Deviation Usually refers to a frequency deviation of the carrier
signal as produced by an FM transmitter. Over-deviation of an FM
transmitter’s carrier can produce “out-of-channel” emissions.
Frequency discriminator A circuit used in an FM receiver to
produce an audio signal contained in the FM-modulated RF carrier
signal.
Frequency modulation Commonly referred to as FM, this is a
process whereby the frequency of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal. The
frequency of the modulating signal determines the rate or number of
times that the carrier frequency varies each second. Frequency-modulation modes used in amateur radio include frequency-shift telegraphy
and radiotelephone.
Frequency stability As related to transmitters, frequency stability
describes the ability to maintain a constant carrier frequency under
such conditions as on-off keying, varying power-line voltages, and
changes in temperature. For example, poor frequency stability in CW
transmitters reduces intelligibility of copy and may cause out-of-band
transmissions.
Harmonic radiation Harmonic radiation is an undesired signal
produced in transmitters. The frequency of the harmonic radiation

273

Ch08_Laster_136187-1

12:50 PM

Page 274

274 CHAPTER EIGHT
may be a multiple of the fundamental or desired signal. Modern HF
transmitters usually have a built-in low-pass filter in their RF output
circuits.
Key chirps Usually caused by poor frequency stability, key chirps
occur as a result of changes in the carrier frequency when the transmitter is keyed on. The sound of the CW signal has a distinct “chirp”
at the instant the transmitter is keyed. In order to minimize or eliminate this problem, some CW transmitters are designed with a constanton “free-running” RF oscillator and the carrier wave is keyed on and
off in the RF amplifier stages.
Key clicks Unlike key chirps, key-click problems are encountered
primarily with switching on and off the RF amplifier stages. This sudden transition from off to on and from on to off can cause annoying
transient signals to appear on the carrier wave. Usually, key clicks can
be eliminated with a key-click filter installed across the key terminals.
A related problem in keying some CW transmitters is that of unintentional radiation of a small portion of the carrier wave during key-up
conditions. This is caused by a small amount of the RF energy from the
RF oscillator leaking through the unkeyed RF amplifier stages to the
antenna terminals. Adequate RF shielding, decoupling networks, and
proper neutralization of the first RF amplifier will generally clear up
this type of problem.
Modulation A term used to describe the process of combining an
information signal (such as a voice or phone) with a radio signal.
Phone emissions This refers to telephony or voice signals usually
transmitted as AM, FM, or SSB emissions.
Product detector A circuit used in a single-sideband (SSB)
receiver to detect or demodulate the SSB signal to produce an audio
signal.
RF amplifier An integral part of most transmitters, one or more
RF amplifiers are used to boost the power of the carrier wave to usable
levels. The RF amplifier may use tubes, transistors, or a combination
of both as the active amplifying devices.
RF carrier The unmodulated RF signal or wave generated by a
transmitter is referred to as the carrier or carrier signal. Normally the
carrier is an RF signal of constant amplitude and frequency. The carrier
can be modulated either in terms of amplitude or frequency changes in
order to convey information to the intended receiving station.

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO TRANSMITTERS

RF oscillator Sometimes referred to as the master oscillator, this
section of the transmitter generates the initial carrier signal prior to
amplification of conversion. Most transmitters employ a variable-frequency oscillator for controlling the frequency of the output carrier
wave. Other transmitters use a crystal oscillator for the master oscillator function.
Single-sideband (SSB) signals Single-sideband signals may be
either upper (USB) or lower sideband (LSB) and convey the original
audio signal used to modulate the SSB transmitter. Normally, only
one set of signal frequencies, USB or LSB, is transmitted by the
transmitter.
Splatter interference sideband When a transmitter’s output carrier is overmodulated by the modulating signal, RF signals of other frequencies, or “splatter signals,” are produced.
Spurious emissions Spurious emissions are those unintentional
radiations from electronic equipment such as transmitters, which can
cause interference to other electronic equipment. For example, an HF
amateur transmitter may inadvertently radiate interfering signals in
the television broadcast frequencies and cause television interference
(TVI). Usually the frequency of a spurious emission is different from
that of the carrier and may be completely out of the amateur bands.
Some spurious emissions can be eliminated by installing filter networks in the transmission line.
Superimposed hum Poor filtering in an ac power supply for a
transmitter can cause 60 or 120 Hz hum to be mixed with the output
carrier signal. The carrier signal is modulated with this low-frequency
audio signal and produces an objectionable sound to the listener. The
problem can usually be cleared up by installing adequate filter capacitors in the power supply.
VFO The variable frequency oscillator (VFO) circuit is used to
help produce the transmitter carrier signal output.

The CW Transmitter
Continuous-wave (CW) transmitters are used to transmit information
with a series of short and long pulses of radio-frequency (RF) energy.
To accomplish this, the transmitter’s carrier RF signal is turned on
and off by a hand or automatic keyer. These on-off transmissions

275

276 CHAPTER EIGHT
convey information in the form of International Morse code characters, a universal language among amateur radio operators worldwide.
The CW transmitter is relatively simple to build and operate. With
one or two transistors (or vacuum tubes), the Technician operator can
assemble a CW transmitter capable of contacting other hams at distances of hundreds to thousands of miles.
The earliest amateur transmitters, described in Chap. 1, utilized
spark gaps for generating damped radio waves. These old transmitters
sometimes produced only a few watts of power spread over a wide
band of frequencies. This caused considerable interference with other
amateur stations and commercial “wireless” facilities. The introduction of the vacuum tube resulted in constant-amplitude carrier signals
with good frequency stability. The development of crystal oscillators
and highly stable variable-frequency oscillators improved the frequency stability of transmitters to a fine degree. Today, the transistor
has all but replaced the vacuum tube for generating RF energy.
A simple CW transmitter, illustrated by the block diagram in Fig.
8.4, consists of an RF oscillator, a hand key, and a dc power source.
Many amateur operators launched their careers in amateur radio using
a one-tube or one-transistor transmitter. Today, some amateur operators employ a single-transistor CW transmitter for challenging contacts
with other hams. For optimum frequency stability, these simple transmitters are crystal controlled.
The one-transistor transmitter has the disadvantage of low power
output. Also, changes in loading effects from the transmission line and
antenna are reflected back into the oscillator circuit, which can cause
frequency stability problems. Even the swinging of the antenna in the
wind can cause changes in frequency.

The Master Oscillator Power Amplifier Transmitter
A significant improvement over the single-stage RF oscillator type of
transmitter is the master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA). This type
of transmitter, shown in Fig. 8.5, has separate stages for oscillator and
amplifier functions. Greater frequency stability as well as higher
power output can be obtained from this circuit. The RF power amplifier isolates the RF oscillator from external loading effects in addition
to providing power amplification of the RF signal. An LC-tuned oscil-

tion in your “ham shack.” (Figure 8.1 shows a photograph of this CW
transmitter with the top cover removed.)
Functional data taken from the Ramsey Model QRP-40 Transmitter’s instruction manual shows the following circuit description:
Transistor Q1 is configured in a crystal oscillator circuit that can be
switched to two separate frequencies of operation. Switch S1 selects
one of two internally installed crystals. The R1/D3/D5/L1 varactorcontrolled series resonant circuit establishes the crystal oscillator frequency. Adjusting R1 allows the crystal oscillator frequency to be
varied up to 5 kHz about the crystal frequency. This feature permits
you to adjust your operating frequency away from other existing signals on the air.
The output RF signal from Q1 is fed to the Driver Q2, which acts as
a buffer between the crystal oscillator stage and the final amplifier
stage. Q3 is a Class C RF amplifier that amplifies the RF signal to about
1 watt of output power. The C7/L6/C18 “pi” output network forms a
low-pass filter that matches the low impedance output of Q3 to the
antenna impedance of about 50 ohms. Diodes D1/D2, along with resistors R11/R12/R13, and the L5 RFC “RF choke” form an electronic
transmit-receive switching network which switches the antenna to
either the transmitter or the receiver.
Dc power to the transmitter is applied through an electronic keying
circuit employing transistor Q4 and a biasing network. When the telegraph or hand key is pressed down to transmit the dots and/or dashes
of Morse code:
1. Q4 conducts 12 VDC to Oscillator Q1 and applies a positive bias
to the base of Driver Q2 through R8. This turns on the crystal oscillator stage and applies a low-level RF signal to the driver stage. Q2
amplifies the RF signal and applies it to the base of the Q3 Final
Amplifier for amplification to about 1 watt of RF power. Note that
12 VDC power to the buffer and final amplifier stages is always
present, eliminating keying action which could produce clicks and
chirps.
2. Q4 also conducts 12 VDC through choke L4 to the anode of Diode
D1, thus conducting the amplified RF signal power to the antenna
through the low-pass filter section. The 12 VDC from Q4 also

279

Ch08_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:50 PM

Page 280

280 CHAPTER EIGHT
applies a negative bias to the cathode of D2, which blocks the highlevel RF signal from the transmitter from entering the receiver.
(Actually, a tiny amount of power does reach the receiver, permitting the operator to hear the transmitted signal and ensure that the
receiver is tuned to the frequency of the transmitted signal.)
3. When the telegraph key is released—completing the intended
transmission of each dot or dash of the Morse code—the 12 VDC
power is removed from the oscillator stage, the driver stage, and
Diode D1. This turns off the RF signals and opens the D1 diode. The
12 VDC applied to R13 can now provide a positive bias to Diode
D2, permitting the signals intercepted by the antenna to be applied
to the receiver.

Amplitude-Modulated Transmitters
The Technician Class operator is authorized single-sideband (SSB)
voice modulation on a portion of the 10-meter band as well as all amateur modes of operation on 6 meters and above. The General and
higher class operators are authorized voice modulation modes on
specified portions of all amateur bands from 160 meters up. This
increased scope of operation is a powerful incentive for continuing to
improve your knowledge of amateur radio and upgrade to the General
Class license. In this chapter, we’ll look at basic AM and SSB radio
telephone transmitters for operation in the HF band and frequency
modulation (FM) transmitters used primarily in the VHF and above.

Conventional AM transmitters
Amplitude modulation is produced when the amplitude of a radio carrier wave is varied in proportion to a modulating signal such as an
audio or voice signal originating from a microphone. Figure 8.7 shows
a block diagram of an AM transmitter. The only observable difference
between the CW transmitter and the AM transmitter is the addition of
a speech or audio modulator, which is capable of varying the amplitude of the output FR carrier wave. In fact, an “outboard” modulator
could be added to the QRP CW 40-meter transmitter in Fig. 8.6 for
phone operation. Although most hams today use SSB modulation,
some hams prefer AM phone on 75- and 40-meter bands.

Here’s how the AM transmitter in Fig. 8.7 works. Note that the RF
sections of this transmitter (VFO RF oscillator, RF amplifier/multiplier, RF power amplifier) are similar to the MOPA CW transmitter
in Fig. 8.6. With the addition of a telegraph key circuit, the transmitter in Fig. 8.7 is capable of either CW or AM phone operation on
all HF bands between 3 and 30 MHz. The speech modulator amplifies the low-level audio signals from the microphone, producing a
high-level audio signal. This high-level signal is applied to the RF
power amplifier stage, causing the amplitude of the carrier wave to
be varied from nearly zero to about twice the amplitude of the
unmodulated wave. If the modulating signal is applied to the modulation stage output circuit of the RF power amplifier stage, this is
referred to as high-level modulation. (High-level modulation for

Ch08_Laster_136187-1

12:50 PM

282 CHAPTER EIGHT
solid-state transmitters is accomplished when the audio modulating
signal is applied to the collector circuit of the final RF power transistor stage.) Low-level modulation in solid-state transmitters is produced when the audio modulation signal is applied to the base (or
gate) of the RF power amplifier transistor stage.
The power level of the audio modulating signal for high-level modulation must be approximately one-half that of the carrier wave power.
For example, a 100-watt AM transmitter requires 50 watts of modulating power in order to produce 100 percent modulation.
The RF carrier wave power represents about two-thirds of the
total RF power being radiated from the antenna. The remaining onethird of the RF power is contained within the two sidebands.
Because either sideband contains identical information relating to
the original modulating signal (i.e., the modulating signal such as
voice), the effective transmission of the voice information by single
sideband requires one-sixth of the original power. For all practical
purposes, a 20-watt single-sideband transmitter is as effective as a
120-watt AM transmitter!

AM carrier and sideband signals
The generation of AM signals results in a carrier wave and two identical sets of sideband signals spaced on opposite sides of the carrierwave frequency. Figure 8.8 illustrates the frequency spectrum of a
typical AM signal in the 80-meter band. The carrier wave frequency,
generated by the VFO, is positioned at 3923.0 kHz. Voice signal frequencies from 250 to 2500 Hz are fed to the modulator for amplification to the required power level. When applied to the RF power
amplifier stage, this produces sideband signals below and above the
carrier frequency. The set of lower sideband signals extends down to
3920.5 kHz. In terms of decreasing carrier frequency, the lower sideband appears as an inverted set of frequencies, with the lowest voice
frequencies (around 250 Hz) adjacent to the carrier frequency. The
upper sideband extends up to 3925.5 and appears as a noninverted set
of voice frequencies ranging from the lowest frequencies (around 250
Hz) to the highest.

FIGURE 8.8
Frequency spectrum for an amplitude-modulated signal.

Audio modulation requires a bandwidth of twice the highest
frequency of the modulating signal. For speech signals ranging up to
about 2500 Hz, the AM modulating bandwidth is about 5 kHz.

Single-Sideband Modulation
The disadvantages of AM modulation in terms of wide bandwidths
and power lost in transmitting the carrier wave and both sidebands
can be eliminated by single-sideband (SSB) transmissions. As noted
earlier, the transmitter carrier wave does not contain the information
being conveyed by the person talking into the microphone. All of this
information goes into the two sidebands. Thus, only one sideband
needs to be transmitted. This is the theory behind SSB transmission.
Up to a point, the SSB transmitter is almost identical to the AM
transmitter. A carrier wave and two sidebands are generated in the
initial stages of an SSB transmitter. Figure 8.9 shows the block diagram for a filter type of SSB transmitter. The balanced modulator
stage removes or suppresses the carrier wave, leaving only the two
sidebands. One of these sidebands is removed by a very sharp filter.
The remaining sideband, which appears as a set of audio frequencies
converted to intermediate RF frequencies, can be heterodyned with an

284 CHAPTER EIGHT
RF oscillator to produce the desired RF transmission frequency. After
sufficient amplification, the modulated SSB wave is fed to the antenna
for radiation into space.
The SSB transmitter in Fig. 8.9 covers the 80-meter amateur band
and produces a lower-sideband output signal. A fixed-frequency oscillator, V1, generates an RF carrier wave of 456 kHz. Speech signals from
the microphone are amplified by the speech amplifier stage, V2. When
both the 456-kHz carrier wave and speech signals (nominally 250 to
2500 Hz) are applied to the balanced modulator, the mixing action
removes the 456-kHz signal and produces modulated lower and upper
sidebands. The lower sideband frequencies extend from 453.5 kHz to
455.75 kHz, representing the 250- to 2500-Hz speech modulating signals. Conversely, the upper sideband contains frequencies from 456.25

output of the balanced modulator containing the two sidebands. This
is a form of modulation known as double-sideband suppressed-carrier
modulation. If applied directly to the mixer stage (V4 in Fig. 8.9) this

would result in transmission of a doublesideband suppressed-carrier signal. Some
of the earlier sideband transmitters
employed this mode of transmission.
When applied to the sharp bandpass

electromechanical or quartz-crystal filters

the 80-meter band by the mixer stage, V4,
and a variable frequency oscillator, V5. In
order to cover the 80-meter band, the VFO
must be able to produce a signal between
3044 kHz and 3544.0 kHz.
For upper-sideband operation, the freC

transmitters employ a crystal oscillator Forms of amplitude-modulated signals. (A) Doublesideband suppressed-carrier modulation. (B) Lowerfor this stage with a capability for switchsideband modulation (upper-sideband and carrier are

mission. Changing this oscillator frequency to 453.5 kHz shifts the lower sideband below the passband of
the sharp filter and centers the upper sideband within the passband
of the filter.
Operation for the other amateur HF bands (40 to 10 meters) can
be obtained by changing the frequency coverage of the VFO and the
tuned LC networks in the linear RF power amplifier. Most amateur
HF SSB transmitters contain switching networks for quickly changing to any desired band of operation. Figure 8.10B and C illustrates
the frequency spectrum of both lower- and upper-sideband transmissions.
The last stage of the SSB transmitter, the linear RF power amplifier,
must possess two basic characteristics. First, the input tuned network
must pass only the desired RF frequencies from the mixer stage. The

mixer.
The second characteristic of the RF power output amplifier is that
it must provide for uniform or linear amplification. Linear amplifiers
in subtransmitters are usually operated in Class-B or -AB modes in
order to obtain linear amplification.
The power output of SSB transmitters is normally specified in
terms of peak envelope power, or pep. This is a practical way to rate
SSB transmitter power because no carrier wave is radiated and during
conditions of no modulation, the transmitter does not produce an RF
output. Average power is difficult to measure due to the differing
characteristics of voice signals. Also, dc ammeters or voltmeters cannot provide an accurate indication of the power output. An approximation can be made by multiplying the indicated average power by a
factor of two. For example, if the plate-current meter of an SSB transmitter indicates about 100 mA during modulation with a plate supply
voltage of 750 volts dc, the average power input to the final stage is
approximately:
Output signals

F1F2,
F1 and F2

Pavg  VP × I  750 × 0.1  75 watts
The pep produced by the SSB transmitter is approximately twice the
indicated average power, or about 150 watts in this example.
The effective “talk power” of SSB transmitters is superior to that of
conventional AM transmitters with the same-rated power output levels. In the example just given, the final RF amplifier stage has a power
dissipation of 75 watts with a peak effective power of about 150 watts.
An AM transmitter of similar power ratings will produce about 75
watts of power during periods of no modulation. When modulated,
the total power of the carrier and the two sidebands is approximately

Ch08_Laster_136187-1

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO TRANSMITTERS

110 watts. Only one-sixth of this power, or about 18 watts, is contained
in each of the sidebands. This illustrates the tremendous advantage of
SSB transmitters over AM transmitters. Along with the advantage of
requiring less bandwidth, it is no wonder that SSB is the most popular
mode of voice communication in the crowded HF amateur bands.
Most amateur equipment available for the HF bands consists of multipurpose transceivers, or combination transmitter and receiver units.
The transceiver combines the use of common circuits such as the master oscillator and common RF, IF, and audio amplifiers. This makes possible a more compact unit as well as reducing the overall cost of an
amateur radio station. Figure 8.12 shows a modern, all solid-state HF
transceiver capable of CW and SSB operation over all authorized amateur bands from 80 to 10 meters. The 100-watt peak input transmitter
power and sensitive receiver characteristics make this transceiver and
similar models popular with both beginning and experienced hams.
Specifications and pricing information on this transceiver and similar
equipment are available in most amateur magazines such as CQ, Ham
Radio, QST, and 73.

288 CHAPTER EIGHT
Frequency Modulation
Another form of RF modulation used by amateurs is that of frequency
modulation (FM). Here the frequency of the RF carrier wave is varied
within limits by an audio (or other low-frequency signal such as RTTY
or data) signal waveform. FM provides certain advantages over AM
modulation systems. However, those advantages come at a price.
Radio communications via FM systems offer clear, noise-free reception of voice and other amateur FM signals. Even in the presence of highambient electrical noise and interference, FM communications sytems
provide virtually crystal-clear signal reception. These characteristics are
ideal for amateur repeater operation in the VHF and UHF where many
ham radios are installed or used in automobiles and other vehicles.
Another teature of FM communications is the “capture effect.” An
FM receiver will always “lock on” to the strongest signal and ignore
weaker ones. This is excellent for a two-way contact with a ham
friend. However, it prevents another ham with a weaker signal from
calling you. This is the reason why airport control-tower operators use
conventional amplitude modulation radios for contacting and directing aircraft activity. In this instance, the control-tower operators can
hear weaker signals from more distant aircraft.
On the negative side, FM systems normally require more bandwidth than similar AM systems. One reason for this is that the FM
modulation process generates a series of sideband signals extending
well past the frequency of the modulating audio signal. For example,
FM broadcast stations require a bandwidth of 150 kHz to transmit a
high-fidelity sudio signal of 50 to 15,000 Hz. This results in a / 75
kHz deviation. Amateur radio FM transmitters use a “narrow-band”
FM modulation system, which generates sidebands up to / 5000 Hz
when modulated by a voice signal with a frequency range of 300 to
3000 Hz. The total RF bandwidth required to transmit this FM signal
is given by
BW  2 (M

D) Hz

where
BW is the required RF bandwidth
M is the maximum modulation frequency in Hz
D is the peak deviation in Hz

(Eq. 8.1)

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO TRANSMITTERS

The wide-bandwidth FM RF signals become distorted when transmitted via skywave propagation modes. This is due to the changing
phase of the different frequency components of the transmitted signal.
This limitation prevents use of FM modulation methods at frequencies
below the amateur 10-meter band.

FM transmitters
Modern FM transmitters employ several methods of generating FM
signals. A popular circuit is the “direct FM” modulator, which
employs a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). Conventional LC RF
oscillators use an LC resonance circuit (refer to the “The Tuned LC
Oscillator” in Chap. 7). If the capacitance of the capacitor in the LC
resonant circuit can be varied by an audio signal voltage waveform,
this change in capacitance will vary the frequency of the RF oscillator. The amount of change of frequency from this circuit is relatively
small. By designing the VCO oscillator for a low RF frequency and
using frequency multiplier stages, the center frequency of the AM
signal can be raised to the desired VHF or UHF channel. Some FM
transmitters employ frequency synthesizer circuits to generate and
maintain accurate RF channel frequencies. A block diagram of a typical VHF modern FM transmitter is given in Fig. 8.13 for a simple,
single-channel VHF FM transmitter. Audio (voice) signals generated
by the microphone are amplified by the AF amplifier and applied to
the VCO. These audio signals cause the frequency of the VCO to vary
as a function of the original voice signals. The amount of frequency
change (or deviation) is a function of the voice signal’s amplitude,
and the number of frequency swings is a function of the original
voice frequency. The frequency changes at the output of the VCO
stage are small. Frequency multipliers (harmonic generators)
increase the VCO’s center frequency (eightfold in this example) to
the VHF channel’s authorized operating frequency (147.2 MHz)
while increasing the final maximum frequency deviation to 5000
Hz. In this example, the maximum output of the FM transmitter
reuqires a bandwidth of 16 kHz. Channel spacing and frequency
allocations for FM operation on the amateur bands are established
by a regional frequency coordinator group made up of amateur operators.

Transmitter Performance Tests
The FCC requires that all licensed amateur operators monitor their
transmitters to ensure that emissions are always within the authorized
frequency and power limits. This means that you must have the capability to determine the performance of your transmitter at any time.
This section covers some of the basic methods and test equeipment
used in checking the transmitter for proper operation.

Transmitter frequency measurements
Several types of equipment are available for determining the output
frequency of the transmitter. In addition, this equipment will help to
detect the presence of spurious radiation outside of the authorized
amateur bands.
An accurately calibrated HF receiver is one of the simplest
approaches to monitoring transmitter output signals. One way to
ensure the calibration accuracy of the receiver involves the use of a frequency marker or frequency standard. If the receiver does not have
this capability, an external frequency standard can be assembled using
the crystal oscillator circuits described in Chap. 7.
A general-coverage receiver is useful in determining the presence
of spurious signals outside of the amateur bands. For example, a 0.5-

Ch08_Laster_136187-1

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO TRANSMITTERS

291

to 30-MHz receiver is capable of tuning to spurious signals within this
frequency range. However, if the receiver is limited to amateur band
coverage, it cannot be used to detect spurious signals outside of the
amateur bands. Other means, such as an absorption wave meter, may
be employed for this purpose.

Frequency counters
The development of digital integrated-circuit chips, such as the 7400
TTL series, has made possible low-cost, highly accurate frequency
counters. When calibrated with the precise frequency transmissions
from the National Bureau of Standard’s WWV and WWVH transmitters, the digital frequency counter can exhibit errors of less than 100
Hz in the amateur HF bands. Figure 8.14 shows a typical frequency
counter.
The sensitivity of most frequency counters is on the order of 50
to 100 mV (millivolts). This allows you
to check the frequency of the low-power
oscillator as well as other circuits.
However, the output of a high power
amplifier should never be connected
directly to a frequency counter. The high
RF voltages can burn out the input circuit of the counter. When making frequency measurements on a high-power
amplifier, a small 2- to 3-turn coil can be
used to pick up sufficient RF signal voltage for the counter’s input circuit. Many
modern trnsmitters and transceivers
have an external jack for connecting a
frequency counter. Also, the newer
“hand-held”frequency counters have a
small whip antenna to “sniff” out the freFIGURE 8.14

Transmitter power measurements
Paragraph 97.313 (Transmitter Power Standards) of the FCC Part 97
Rules and Regulations (see Chap. 2) states the RF power limitations of
an amateur radio station. Thus the amateur operator needs some capability to measure the RF power output to the antenna.
The inherent design of modern transmitters and transceivers provides an indication of the expected RF power output. Thus a 2-meter
FM, 3-watt Handie-talkie will provid a power out of approximately 3
watts. The same is true for a 100-watt HF transceiver. The power output will usually never exceed 100 watts for any amateur band. However, the power output of some transceivers in the higher RF bands
may drop below the stated 100 watts.
Many of the modern RF power amplifiers in the 600- to 1000-watt
category use transmitting-type vacuum tubes. These tubes may be triodes or screen-grid tetrodes. (Yes, these types of tubes are still being
manufactured.) The power output of these amplifiers is defined as the
sum of the plate power and the screen-grid power (for tetrodes) during
key-down conditions. The output power of solid state (transistor)
power amplifiers can be calculated in a similar manner if access to the
collector voltage and current can be determined.
Example. During the key-down operation, a tube-type RF power amplifier has the
following characteristics:

dc plate voltage  600 Vdc
dc plate current  300 mA dc
dc screen voltage  300 Vdc
dc screen current  10 mA dc
filament current  500 mA ac
Compute the power output of the RF power amplifier and determine if this power is within the legal limits for the HF bands authorized for the Technician operator with 5 WPM certification. This
power limit is 200 watts pep. Note: All other amateur operators,
including Technician operators, must observe this power limitation
when operating on these band segments.

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO TRANSMITTERS

If you have wondered how the output power of RF transistor power
amplifiers can be determined, the theoretical answer is relatively simple. Simply multiply the transistor’s collector current by the Vcc supply voltage—the answer will be in watts. However, you may
experience difficulties in measuring the collector current. Also, the
compact construction may invite accidental shorting of components
and cause costly transistors to be destroyed. Don’t attempt this procedure unless you are an experienced technician.
Solution.

A review of the data given in this example shows that the filament power
is not considered when calculating RF power output. Accordingly, this
data will be ignored.

Step 1. Calculate the plate power:
Pp  VpIp

(Eq. 8.2)

where
Pp is the plate input power in watts
Vp is the dc plate voltage in volts
Ip is the dc plate current in amperes
Thus,
Pp  600 V  0.3 A  180 watts
Step 2. Calculate the screen grid power:
Ps  Vs Is
where
Ps is the screen power in watts
Vs is the screen grid voltage in volts
Is is the screen grid current in amperes
Thus,
Ps  300 V  0.010 A  3 watts
Step 3. Add the values obtained from Steps 1 and 2 to obtain total
output power for the RF power amplifier:
Ptotal  180

3  183 watts

Both dc voltmeters and ammeters (or a
multimeter set up for dc measurements)
can be used to monitor the voltages and
currents associated with the operation of
the final RF power amplifier stage of the
transmitter or transceiver. Many transmitters and transceivers incorporate a dc or
RF ammeter for continual monitoring of
the final amplifier current during “tuneup” and normal operation. Commercial RF
watt meters for “in-line” connection with
the antenna transmission line or with
dummy loads are available for hams who
regularly use high-power RF power amplifiers. Also, when amateur operators want
to experiment with RF circuits and antennas, they will want to continually monitor
power output levels. Figure 8.15 shows an
in-line RF wattmeter which provides true
peak power measurements of CW, AM,
FM, and SSB modes of operation. Many
antenna tuners (covered in Chap. 10)
incorporate power meters for monitoring
output RF power levels. Finally, designs
for “home-brew” construction of RF
power meters are available in amateur
publications.

he antenna connected to the amateur radio receiver in your ham
shack may collect hundreds to thousands of radio signals at any one
time. The frequencies of these signals may range from the AM broadcast band and below, to the VHF and UHF FM and TV broadcast bands
and above. In between these extreme frequency limits are amateur,
government, commercial, maritime, and other communications services. The amplitudes of these signals being fed into the antenna terminals of the receiver vary from less than 1 microvolt to many
millivolts. Many amateur contacts are made with received signals on
the order of a few microvolts.
The purpose of the amateur receiver is twofold: select, amplify, and
demodulate the desired radio signal; and reject all other signals. The
old amateur expression “If you can’t hear ‘em, you can’t work ‘em” is
most appropriate for this discussion.
Amateur receivers are available as separate pieces of equipment
or as part of a transceiver. Many excellent commercial receivers, new
or used, are available to help get you on the air as soon as possible.

display, and transmission modes; and a built-in hf automatic antenna tuner. The transciever
operates on 13.8 vdc, 20 amperes, maximum power source (battery or external ac power
supply) and can be operated as a mobile or fixed station radio.

Sometimes you will find used receivers, in good operating condition, at local ham swap-fests or conventions. Replacement transistors,
vacuum tubes, and other parts can usually be obtained from local electronics stores, swap-fasts, and advertisements in amateur radio journals.
These old “boat anchors” can give you years of good service, either as
the primary receiver or as a back-up receiver in your ham station.
Amateur receivers in kit form are available from many commercial
suppliers. Figure 9.2 shows the HR-40, a 40-meter, single-band

with a transmitter kit, is an exciting as well as inexpensive way to get
on the air as soon as possible.

Definitions
The following definitions of terms related
to receivers are important to both the beginner and the licensed amateur radio operator. The Technician exam will include
questions on the theory and operation of
amateur radio receivers.
Beat frequency oscillator (BFO) The
BFO stage in a receiver generates a high-frequency signal that is mixed or heterodyned
with the incoming modulated carrier, such
as a CW signal. This mixing action proFIGURE 9.2

diode.
Frequency-selective networks Frequency-selective networks are used in receivers to pass or reject
RF, IF, or audio signals. These networks may consist of parallel or
series LC circuits, quartz crystal filters, mechanical filters, or a
combination of these devices.
Intermediate-frequency (IF) amplifiers The IF amplifier in superheterodyne receivers is a fixed-frequency, high-gain amplifier that
exhibits sharp selectivity. The IF amplifier is usually connected between
the mixer and demodulator stages of the receiver. Some receivers employ
two or more stages of IF amplification.
Local oscillator The local oscillator is used in superheterodyne
receivers to generate a high-frequency signal. This signal is mixed
with the incoming modulated carrier signal, producing the IF signal.
Local oscillators may be tunable or fixed-frequency, depending on
how they are used in the receiver.

298 CHAPTER NINE
Product detector The product detector is incorporated in some CW
and SSB receivers to demodulate the incoming modulated carrier signal.
Receiver In communications terms the receiver is a device for
receiving selected radio signals from an antenna and processing these
signals for the required output form.
Receiver overload This condition occurs when the antenna collects a strong signal and desensitizes the receiver and the desired signal is distorted or no longer heard. Receiver overload can occur
regardless of the frequency the receiver is tuned to. Front-end overload
is another name given to receiver overload.
Radio-frequency (RF) amplifier The RF amplifier used in most
receivers amplifies the incoming RF signal from the antenna. The RF
amplifier provides for some selectivity and limited gain characteristics.
Superheterodyne receiver The superheterodyne receiver combines the incoming RF signal with the output from a local oscillator to
produce an intermediate-frequency signal. The IF signal is amplified ,
demodulated, and converted to an appropriate output signal, such as
the audio signal required by headphones or speakers.
Tuned radio-frequency (TRF) receiver An early form of radio
receiver, the TRF receiver employs one or more stages of RF amplification followed by a demodulator and audio amplifier. Usually, the
TRF receiver does not provide the gain and selectivity offered by the
superheterodyne receiver.

Receiver Basics
Amateur radio receivers must be able to pick up extremely weak signals, separate these signals from noise and the many strong signals
always present on the air, have adequate frequency stability to hold to
the desired signals, and demodulate the radio signals for reproduction.
In general, receiver performance can be rated in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and frequency stability. Additional factors related to
the operational capability of the receiver include frequency coverage,
demodulation or detector modes (CW, AM, SSB, or FM), frequency
readout, and power requirements.
Although receivers vary in complexity and performance, they all
have four basic functions: reception, selection, demodulation, and
reproduction. These functions are illustrated in the simple receiver

shown in Fig. 9.4. Some of these functions employ amplifiers to boost
the signals to usable levels.

Reception
Reception is the ability of the receiver to process weak signals being
collected by the antenna. This is related primarily to the sensitivity of
the receiver. Most receivers contain several amplifier stages to produce
the large amounts of gain required to boost the signals from levels of
microvolts to volts. Thus, the total gain of a receiver may be on the
order of a million to one.
Factors influencing receiver sensitivity include electrical noise
generated in the antenna circuits and within the receiver, particularly
in the front-end or RF stages. Electrical noise is produced by thermal
agitation of molecules in a conductor and within amplifying devices
such as transistors and tubes. In general, electrical noise is independent of frequency and increases with temperature and bandwidth.
Any noise present at the antenna terminals of a receiver is amplified along with the signal being received. Thus, there is a limit to the
sensitivity that a receiver can possess. Most modern receivers have a
sensitivity of 1 microvolt or less. Many receiver specifications define

noise/noise). For example, a sensitivity of 0.5 microvolt for a 10-dB (S
+ N)/N simply means that the amplitude of the noise generated in the
receiver is about 10 dB below a signal level of 0.5 microvolt. Stated in
an alternate manner, the “noise floor” of the receiver is about 0.16
microvolts. Any signal below this level will be masked by the noise
and will not be heard in the speaker.
For HF frequencies below about 20 to 30 MHz, external noise
(atmospheric and man-made) is usually well above internal receiver
noise. Most HF receivers have an adequate sensitivity to handle signals in this frequency range.

Selection or selectivity
Selection or selectivity is the ability of the receiver to tune to a desired
signal and reject unwanted signals with frequencies other than that of
the desired signal. A receiver employs high-Q LC tank circuits or special crystal filters to pass only a narrow band of frequencies. Thus, the
passband or bandwidth of the receiver is all-important in rejecting
unwanted signals. Figure 9.4 illustrates the bandwidths of two
receivers. Both receivers are tuned to the same signal at 7165 kHz.

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO RECEIVERS

Unwanted CW signals are also present at 7162 and 7168 kHz. The
sharp selectivity of receiver A effectively rejects the two unwanted signals. Receiver B has a broad selectivity that passes all three signals,
causing interference to the operator.
The selectivity of many modem CW receivers is on the order of several hundred hertz. This is adequate for rejecting most signals close to
the frequency of operation. All SSB and AM receivers should have a
selectivity of about 2500 Hz for amateur voice operation. Many
CW/SSB receivers and transceivers employ switchable filters to permit optimum reception of either type of signal.

Demodulation or detection
Demodulation or detection is the process of separating the lowfrequency intelligence (usually an audio signal) from the incoming
modulated carrier signal. Solid-state devices or vacuum tubes are
used in receiver detector circuits.
The two more common types of detectors used in HF receivers are
the diode detector for CW and AM and the product detector for CW or
SSB signals. Figure 9.3 illustrates the diode detector. A product detector is shown in Fig. 9. 5. The n-channel FET serves as a mixer where

the IF signals are mixed with the audio-frequency signal from the BFO.
The low-pass audio filter consisting of C4RFC2C5 prevents the IF or
BFO signals from entering the audio amplifier. The product detector is
useful for demodulating either CW or SSB signals.

Reproduction
The final process in receiving a radio signal is to convert the detected
signal to an audio signal to drive a speaker or headphones. Usually a
high-gain audio amplifier is used to amplify the weak signals from the
detector stage. The output of the audio amplifier is then fed to either a
speaker or headphones for reproduction.
Most HF receivers have an internal speaker and an output jack for
headphone operation. The simple single-stage audio amplifier shown
in Fig. 9.3 is suitable for headphone operation. A two- or three-stage
audio amplifier is usually required for driving a speaker.

Simple Receivers
The first radio receivers were simple devices consisting of nothing
more than a tuned circuit, crystal detector, and headphones. Figure
9.6 shows a typical crystal set that is capable of receiving local AM
broadcast stations. Parts for this simple receiver can be obtained from
most local electronic parts houses or from discarded AM tube-type or
transistor radios. Kits such as the Radio Shack Crystal AM Radio Kit,
Catalog No. 28-177, are also available for constructing a crystal set.
The crystal set cannot properly demodulate CW or SSB signals.
Also, the sensitivity and selectivity of this type of circuit is not adequate for amateur operation. Additional sensitivity can be obtained by
adding an audio amplifier to the output of the crystal set.

Tuned radio-frequency (TRF) receivers
Receiver sensitivity and selectivity can be improved by the addition
of one or more stages of radio-frequency amplification. This type of
receiver is called the TRF receiver. Figure 9.3 is basically a TRF
receiver design. Many commercial AM receivers built in the 1920s
and 1930s used the TRF approach. Some of these receivers employed
two to four stages of RF amplification to obtain the required sensitivity and selectivity.

Direct-conversion receivers
The direct-conversion receiver, shown in Fig. 9.7, is a simple and popular approach for receiving CW and SSB signals. The received signal is
applied to the detector stage along with an RF signal generated by the
HF oscillator. The frequency of the HF oscillator signal is slightly
higher (or lower) than the frequency of the incoming signal to produce
an audio beat frequency. For example, if the incoming signal frequency is 7155.0 kHz and the HF oscillator is tuned to 7155.4 kHz, a
400-Hz audio signal is produced by the mixing action in the detector.
This 400-Hz signal is applied to the high-gain audio amplifier through
a very narrow bandwidth audio filter.
Selectivity in this type of receiver is accomplished by LC tuned networks ahead of the detector stage and the audio filter between the
detector and audio amplifier.
Many amateur designs for the direct conversion receiver have been
developed over the past few years. Many of these designs employ the
Signetics NE602 Oscillator-Mixer IC and the LM386 Audio Amplifier
IC. The popular Ramsey HR Series Receiver Kits for 20, 30, 40, and 80
meters employ these two ICs in a direct conversion circuit.

Figure 9.8 shows the circuit for the HR-40 Direct Conversion Receiver
for 40 meters. Here’s how this circuit works. The incoming signal from
the antenna is coupled through C5 and the RF gain control R1, to antenna
input transformer L1. (A 10.2-MHz IF transformer, detuned to cover the
40-meter band, can be substituted.) This “tuned” transformer peaks the
desired signal and applies it to the NE602’s mixer section. The shielded
oscillator coil, L2, along with varactor diode D1, R2, R5, C1, C2, C3, and
C4, form an oscillator network with the NE602’s internal oscillator.
Rotating R2 varies the oscillator’s frequency over a tuning range of about
250 kHz. The NE602 mixes the incoming RF signal with the signal from
the internal oscillator to produce an audio signal at Pin 4.
The output audio signal is coupled to the LM 386 audio amplifier
via coupling capacitor C8 and volume control R3. Capacitor C9 boosts
the voltage gain of the LM386 to about 50. The high-level audio output
is coupled from Pin 5, U2, to external headphones or a low impedance
(4 to 8 ohms) speaker through coupling capacitor C12 and output connector J2.NE602.
An internal 9-volt transistor battery (or an external power source of
about 9–12 Vdc, 60 mA) is used to power the HR-40. Note that zener
diode D2, along with C10 and R4, form a 6.2-Vdc voltage regulator network to improve stability of the NE602’s internal oscillator circuit.

The Superheterodyne Receiver
The superheterodyne receiver, developed in the early 1930s, eliminated most of the problems experienced with earlier types of receivers.
Today, the superheterodyne receiver is used in virtually all types of
radio communications services, including amateur, commercial twoway radio, and AM, FM, and TV broadcast receivers.
The primary difference between the TRF and superheterodyne
receivers is the conversion of the incoming RF signal to an intermediate-frequency (IF) signal by the superheterodyne receiver. Figure 9.9

306 CHAPTER NINE
shows a block diagram for a CW superheterodyne receiver. The addition of the IF amplifier stage provides for controlled high gain and narrow bandwidth selectivity at the IF signal frequency.
To understand the operation of the superheterodyne receiver, each
stage is discussed in detail. The superheterodyne receiver shown in
Fig. 9.9 indicates operation in the 80-meter band. However, any amateur band could have been selected for this example. Band switching
circuits in the RF and local-oscillator stages provide for operation on
80 through 10 meters in most amateur HF receivers and transceivers.
Sometimes the tuning capacitors in the RF and local-oscillator stages
are ganged for single-knob tuning to the desired frequency of operation. For example, the RF stage in Fig. 9.9 can be tuned from 3500
to 4000 kHz while the local-oscillator frequency ranges from 3955 to
4455 kHz. At any frequency within the 80-meter band, the local-oscillator frequency is 455 kHz above that of the incoming RF signal.
When switch S1 in Fig. 9.9 is set to the CW/SSB position, either
CW or SSB signals can be received. In the AM position, the beat-frequency oscillator is disabled and the receiver will receive conventional AM signals. An automatic gain control (AGC) amplifier is

included to compensate for variations in the incoming signal level.
The output of the AGC amplifier is a dc voltage that controls the gain
of the IF and RF amplifier stages. The S meter is also connected to the
AGC amplifier stage to show relative levels of incoming signals.

RF amplifiers
The RF amplifier contains LC tuned circuits that provide for some
selectivity and limited gain at the desired signal frequency. The RF
amplifier also provides two additional advantages in the superheterodyne receiver. First, it isolates the mixer and local-oscillator stages
from the antenna circuits, preventing radiation of the local-oscillator
signal from the antenna.
The second advantage of the RF amplifier is that it attenuates
unwanted image signals appearing at the antenna terminals. The
image signal frequency differs from the desired signal frequency by
twice the IF frequency. In Fig. 9.9, the desired signal frequency is 3735
kHz and the image frequency is 4645 kHz (or 3735 kHz plus
2 × 455 kHz). If allowed to reach the mixer stage, the 4645-kHz image
signal would mix with the 4190-kHz local-oscillator signal and produce another 455-kHz signal into the IF amplifier. The ratio of the
desired signal level to that of the image frequency signal level is called
the image rejection ratio.

Local oscillators
The local oscillator generates a constant-amplitude sine-wave signal
whose frequency differs from the frequency of the incoming carrier
signal by an amount equal to the IF frequency. The local-oscillator frequency can be positioned either above or below the incoming carrier
frequency. This selection is determined by the frequency coverage of
the receiver and any requirements for ganged tuning of the RF and
local-oscillator stages. Most local oscillators in AM broadcast receivers
and the lower bands in amateur HF receivers generate a frequency
above that of the incoming carrier frequency.
The tunable local oscillators in superheterodyne receivers must
possess adequate frequency stability for the intended operation. For
example, if the local-oscillator frequency drifts more than several
hundred hertz, this would shift the incoming signal out of the passband of the receiver. For single-sideband operation, a shift of 50 to

100 Hz in the local-oscillator frequency can result in unintelligible
speech at the output.
Frequency stability in the lower amateur HF bands (80 and 40
meters) can usually be achieved by the use of rigid mechanical construction techniques, temperature-compensating components, and a
regulated power supply. However, it is difficult to design LC oscillators for stable operation at frequencies above these bands. Receivers
that employ tunable local oscillators in the higher HF bands represent
a compromise between operational performance and cost.
One approach to achieving frequency stability in the higher HF
bands is the use of crystal-controlled down converters or frequency
translators. Figure 9-10 illustrates a typical 15-meter converter that
translates the 15-meter band down to 3.5 to 3.95 MHz. In this manner,
the 80-meter superheterodyne receiver acts as a variable-IF receiver.
Receivers that use this approach are called double-conversion superheterodyne receivers. Most of these types of receivers contain crystalcontrolled converters for the amateur HF bands above 40 meters. On
80 and 40 meters, the receiver employs a single-conversion approach.
An additional advantage of the double-conversion receiver is
improved image rejection.

Mixers
The purpose of the mixer stage is to convert the frequency of the
incoming carrier signal to that of the IF amplifier. The action of the
mixer is illustrated in Fig. 8.11 in Chapter 8. The mixer produces four
major output signals when driven by two input signals of different frequencies, f1 and f2:
f1  an original input signal frequency,
f2  an original input signal frequency,
f1

f2  sum of the two input frequencies,

f1 – f2 = the difference of the two input frequencies.
Only one of the four mixer output frequencies is used in the superheterodyne receiver, either f1 f2 or f1  f2. The remaining three mixer
output signals can cause interference within the receiver if proper
design steps are not taken.
Tubes, diodes, transistors, or special integrated-circuit chips are used
as the active elements in mixer circuits. A typical MOSFET transistor
mixer circuit is shown in Fig. 9.11. Note that transformer T1 is tuned

to the frequency of the incoming signal while transformer T2 is tuned
to the IF frequency.

Regenerative-detector receivers
The regenerative-detector receiver, shown in Fig. 9.12 in a vacuum
tube circuit, is a simple but highly sensitive receiver. Easy to construct, this circuit has been popular with amateurs since the 1920s and
1930s. Some versions of this receiver employed an RF amplifier stage
to improve selectivity and an audio amplifier to boost the audio output
for speaker operation. Plug-in coils were used for band switching.
The regenerative-detector circuit employs regenerative feedback
from the plate to the grid elements by inductive coupling from L3 to
L2. The amount of feedback is controlled by C3. For CW and SSB operation, the detector circuit is made to oscillate at a frequency slightly
different from that of the incoming signal.
The regenerative-detector receiver has been largely replaced by the
more selective and stable superheterodyne receiver for most amateur
operation. However, the simplicity and low cost of the “gennie” regenerative-detector circuit is very attractive to the experimenter and newcomer to amateur radio.

IF amplifiers
The characteristics of the IF amplifier in a superheterodyne receiver
are best described in terms of high gain and narrow selectivity. Generally speaking, the gain and selectivity of a receiver are determined by
the IF amplifier.

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO RECEIVERS

The selectivity of the IF amplifier must be equal to the bandwidth
of the incoming modulated RF signal. If a greater selectivity is present, any adjacent-frequency signal will be passed through the IF
amplifier and cause interference to the operator. On the other hand,
if the selectivity is too narrow, some of the sidebands contained in
the modulated RF signal will be cut. This results in a loss of fidelity
when the audio portion of the signal is reproduced by the speaker or
headphones.
The optimum selectivity for SSB reception is about 2300 to 2500
Hz. Although some of the higher sidebands associated with speech signals extend beyond 2500 Hz, the loss of these sidebands does not
materially affect the sounds or information being conveyed by the
transmitting operator.
A selectivity of about 400 to 500 Hz is adequate for CW operation.
This narrow selectivity helps to reject any adjacent-frequency CW signal that could interfere with reception of the desired signal.
The more elaborate amateur HF receivers employ two or more
stages of IF amplification preceded by a highly selective crystal or
mechanical filter. With this arrangement, LC tuned circuits or IF transformers are used for interstage coupling.
The selection of the IF frequency is determined by several factors
that include: gain, selectivity, and image signal rejection. For the
lower HF amateur bands (80 and 40 meters), 455 kHz is the IF frequency used in many receivers. The IF amplifiers operating at this
frequency can provide excellent gain and selectivity. Mechanical filters are available for 455-kHz operation with selectivities of about
400 to 2500 Hz.
Receivers with an IF frequency of 455 kHz generally do not have
good image frequency rejection in the higher amateur HF bands (20
meters and above). For operation above 40 meters, IF frequencies
between 1.5 and 10 MHz are used to provide for the required image
frequency rejection. Crystal filters are employed in the better amateur
HF receivers and transceivers to obtain the required selectivity. One
popular IF frequency used in many amateur HF receivers and transceivers is 9 MHz. Four- and eight-pole crystal filters are available from
commercial sources that have selectivities of 2500 Hz for SSB and 500
Hz for CW modes of operation. The number of poles associated with a
crystal filter is related to the number of individual crystal elements
used to obtain the desired selectivity characteristics.

312 CHAPTER NINE
Detectors and beat-frequency oscillators
Detection or demodulation is defined as the process of separating the
audio-frequency components from the modulated carrier signal.
Detectors in superheterodyne receivers are often called second detectors—the mixer stage can be considered as being the first detector.
For conventional AM signals, a diode detector is adequate for
removing the audio signals from the modulated IF carrier signal. This
process was described earlier in this chapter.
The reception of CW and SSB signals requires the mixing of the modulated IF signal with a signal from the beat-frequency oscillator (BFO).
The BFO is used to reinsert a carrier into the IF signal for demodulation
purposes. For CW reception, the BFO frequency is adjusted slightly
higher or lower than that of the IF frequency to produce an audio beatfrequency signal. For example, if the IF frequency is 455 kHz, the BFO
frequency is adjusted to 456 or 454 kHz in order to produce a 1000-Hz
beat frequency. This audio signal is then applied to the audio amplifier
stage to produce an output in the speaker or headphones.

Automatic gain control
The purpose of an automatic-gain-control circuit is to maintain a constant receiver-output level despite variations in the input signal
strength. The HF radio waves being propagated through the ionsophere are alternately attenuated and reinforced by an effect known as
fading. This causes the received signal strength at the antenna terminals to vary over a wide range of values. Because the rectified signal
voltage at the detector stage is proportional to the amplitude of the
received signal, a portion of this voltage can be used to control the gain
of the receiver. For receivers employing vacuum tubes or npn transistors in the stages preceding the detector, a negative voltage is fed back
to these devices for reducing the gain. Amplifiers and mixers employing pnp transistors require a positive voltage to control the amplification of these stages.
Some receivers, particularly the better solid-state types, include an
AGC amplifier to obtain more control over the receiver gain characteristics. These AGC circuits might have different time constants to
aid in receiving different types of signals, such as AM and SSB voice
and CW signals. The time constant of an AGC circuit describes the
length of time that gain control is maintained after the transmitted

Ch09 _Laster_136187-1

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO RECEIVERS

313

signal is terminated. For example, without an appreciable time constant in the AGC circuit, the normal pauses in SSB voice transmissions would allow the receiver to immediately resume full gain
characteristics. This would produce an annoying burst of noise during the intervals between voice signals.

S meters
The S or signal-strength meters are provided in some receivers and
transceivers to indicate relative strength of the incoming signal. Usually a portion of the rectified IF signal from the detector stage is
applied to a microammeter or milliammeter. If the receiver has an AGC
amplifier, this stage can be used to drive the S meter in addition to
controlling the gain of the receiver.
Most S meters are calibrated in terms of S units (S-1 to S-9) up to
about the midscale reading. Figure 9.13 shows a typical S-meter
scale. One S unit represents approximately a 6-decibel change in
received signal strength. A midscale reading, or S-9, is intended to
indicate a signal strength of about 50 microvolts. The upper half of
the S-meter scale is calibrated in decibels above S-9, usually up to 60
decibels. Thus, a signal strength reading of 60 decibels indicates that
the strength of the received signal is 60 dB above 50 microvolts, or
about 50 millivolts.
The S meter is seldom accurate because
many factors influence its operation. However, it is very useful in determining the
relative signal strength of incoming sigS units

314 CHAPTER NINE
tors: external noise, internal noise, and interfering signals. As stated
earlier in this chapter, external noise in the HF frequencies, particularly below about 20 MHz, is much higher than the internal noise generated by HF receivers. Only above approximately 20 MHz does
internal receiver noise become a problem in receiving extremely weak
signals.
The majority of the internal receiver noise is generated in the first
stage, either an RF amplifier or mixer stage. Much research has been
expended in developing low-noise circuits and components to reduce
internal receiver noise to a minimum level.
External noise can cause problems in receiving weak signals in two
ways. First, the noise collected by the antenna can simply mask the
incoming desired signal. If the desired signal is near or below the
incoming noise level, reception is virtually impossible. Some experienced CW operators can copy CW signals through excessive noise levels. However, voice and other amateur signals are unintelligible under
these conditions.

Receiver Overload
Assuming the desired signal is weak but well above external and receiver
noise levels, we might still have difficulty in receiving the desired signal.
Strong RF signals of widely different frequencies can be collected by the
antenna and cause receiver desensitization or front-end overload. For
example, strong signals at the image frequency, can cause direct interference with the desired signal as well as reducing the receiver gain by
developing a high AGC (automatic gain control) voltage.
Other strong signals, at frequencies completely different from the
desired receiving and image frequencies, can produce overloading
effects in the first stage. This front-end loading effect reduces receiver
gain and the desired signal can be distorted or lost. Some receivers
have attenuation networks that can be switched into the input to the
first stage. This reduces the overloading effect on the first stage and
often permits normal amplification of the desired signal. To check for
this type of interference, tune the receiver to different frequencies. If
the receiver still exhibits poor gain and distorted audio output signals,
this is an indication that a strong signal is causing front-end overloading of the receiver.

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO RECEIVERS

Harmonic Signals
Strong undesired signals collected by the antenna might possess a
harmonic frequency equal or close to the desired signal frequency. For
example, a receiver is tuned to 20 MHz and can experience interference from a strong 5 MHz signal. Note that 20 MHz represents the 4th
harmonic of 5 MHz. In order to eliminate interference of this type, filters can be installed at the receiver antenna terminals to reduce these
strong signals to insignificant levels.

Constructing the “Sudden”
160- to 20-Meter Direct Conversion Receiver
The receiver kits described earlier in this chapter make excellent HF
receivers for the beginning amateur operator. However, some amateurs prefer to build a receiver from scratch. The “Sudden” Receiver
described in this construction project was originally developed and
constructed by the Rev. George Dobbs [G3RJV, St. Aidan’s Vicarage,
498 Manchester Rd., Rochdale, Lancs, OL11 3HE, Great Britain.] Rev.
Dobbs’ versatile design of this receiver permits it to be configured for
any amateur band between 160 to 20 meters (160, 80, 40, 30, and 20
meters). He documented the construction of the Sudden Receiver in
the October 1991 issue of 73 Amateur Radio Today. You can assemble this proven receiver in an evening or two of enjoyable effort.
Figure 9.14 shows a schematic diagram for the Sudden Direct
Conversion Receiver. The receiver is a simple design based on two
integrated circuits (ICs) and three inductors. A potentiometer, R1,
acts as an RF control to prevent signal input overload, particularly
on the lower HF bands. The T1/C1/C2/C3/T2 tuned network forms a
bandpass filter for the particular amateur band involved. The NE602
Oscillator-Mixer IC provides the RF mixer and local oscillator functions for direct conversion of the SSB or CW signals to an audio signal. The local oscillator section of the NE602 is connected to a tuned
Colpitts oscillator circuit tuned by T3, C10, and the Variable Capacitor VC1. Note that the receiver tuning range is determined by VC1.
Table 9.1 provides a list of the frequency determining components
that permits you to configure the Sudden Receiver for a particular
amateur band.

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO RECEIVERS

The detected audio output from the NE602 IC is applied to the
LM386 Audio Amplifier via Coupling Capacitor C11 and the Volume
Control R4. The LM386 Amplifier IC is configured for a voltage gain of
about 200 and provides adequate audio output via Coupling Capacitor
C16 for headphone reception. The LM386 Audio Amplifier provides
the necessary gain to amplify the detected audio to usable levels for
headphone listening.
Parts for the Sudden Receiver are listed in Table 9.2. Most of these
parts are readily available in local Radio Shack stores or electronic
supply houses. The Variable Tuning Capacitor VC1 can be difficult to
locate from local suppliers. You can order a variable tuning capacitor
from the source listed in the parts list or salvage a surplus variable
capacitor from an abandoned AM radio.

The Sudden Receiver can be constructed using a variety of construction techniques. Methods of construction for this receiver’s circuitry
include predrilled “prototyping” boards (Radio Shack P/N 276-170,
276-147, or 2726-158) or “perfboard” material (Radio Shack 276-1394).
Receiver checkout and alignment is straightforward with this type
of receiver. You should check the audio section for proper operation
before attempting test and alignment of the RF sections. With power
applied to the LM386 IC, you should hear a loud hum in the headphones when you touch the input terminal at PIN 3. The availability of
an audio oscillator or function generator will permit a more detailed
analysis of the operation of the LM386.
Alignment of the RF and local oscillator sections will require a
source of RF signals, either from an antenna or, better still, from an RF
signal generator. First, you must get the local oscillator tuned to the
desired HF amateur band. Connect a signal from an RF signal generator to C7 or an antenna to the antenna input connector. A QRP CW
transmitter makes an excellent alternate signal source for testing and
aligning the receiver. Adjust the core of T3 until the signal is heard in
the headphones. Now you can align the RF input bandpass filter by
peaking the adjustments of T1 and T2. The final adjustment involves

Ch09 _Laster_136187-1

INTRODUCTION TO RADIO RECEIVERS

the proper band coverage as dictated by the local oscillator tuning
range. You can use a calibrating RF signal in the center of the band
(adjust the Tuning Capacitor VC1 to the center of its range) and then
adjust T3 for maximum reception. An alternate method is to use an RF
calibrating signal at the high end (or the low end) of the band, adjust
the tuning of the Tuning Capacitor VC1 to minimum (or maximum)
capacitance, and adjust T3 for maximum reception. Your “Sudden
Receiver” is now ready for operation. With a companion QRP CW
transmitter, you are ready to get on the air and make exciting contacts
with fellow hams.

FM Receivers
FM receiver design and construction is very similar to that of the
CW/AM/SSB receivers described in earlier sections. Today’s FM
receivers use the superheterodyne concept. Thus the RF, IF, and audio
amplifier and the local oscillator stages for each type of receiver are
virtually identical. To build an FM receiver, you need three additional
stages: a limiter IF stage, an FM detector or demodulator, and a deemphasis stage. By now, you have noticed that most of the newer amateur
radios have an “all-mode” capability. Thus CW, AM, SSB, and FM
modes of communications can be handled by one amateur radio.
Figure 9.15 shows a block diagram of an FM receiver. RF signals collected by the antenna are applied to the RF amplifier stage. This stage
performs two important functions. First, the desired RF signal, sometimes only a few microvolts in amplitude, is amplified before being fed
to the mixer stage. The second function is that the RF amplifier rejects
or suppresses unwanted signals near the operating frequency.
The mixer stage heterodynes or mixes the incoming operating RF
frequency signal with the local oscillator signal. This action produces
the two original signals and the sum and difference frequencies. For
example, let the incoming RF FM signal frequency be 146.00 MHz and
the local oscillator signal frequency be tuned to 135.3 MHz. The mixer
out signals will have four combinations of the above frequencies:
146.0 MHz, 135.3 MHz, 281.3 MHz (from 146.0
135.3 MHz), and
10.7 MHz (from 146.0  135.3 MHz). The new 10.7-MHz signal is the
only one accepted by the tuned 10.7-MHz IF amplifier. Note that both
the sum and difference frequency signals possess the original FM
modulation characteristics. This process converts the FM signal to a

new FM signal frequency. Thus, tuning the FM receiver to any frequency in the design coverage (for example, the 2-meter band of 144.0
to 148 MHz) always produces an IF signal of 10.7 MHz.
Now check the operating frequency of the IF amplifier. It is 10.7
MHz! Since the IF amplifier can operate at a single frequency (plus
and minus the FM modulation sidebands), it can be designed for very
high gain and sharp selectivity. 10.7 MHz is a standard IF frequency
used in most FM receivers. Some FM receivers will have one IF amplifier stage while others will have two or more stages.
The limiter stage, tuned to the 10.7 MHz IF frequency, removes all
amplitude variations of the received signal as well as electrical noise.
This is accomplished by adjusting the limiter amplifier to operate in
the saturated mode. A parallel LC circuit, tuned to 10.7 MHz, restores
the distorted signal to a perfect sinewave with no amplitude variations. The limiter stage is responsible for producing sharp, clear voice
communications!
Unlike the AM detector, the FM detector detects variations in the
frequency of the incoming FM signal. There are many types of FM

detector, each being developed from the electronics state of the art—
from vacuum tubes to transistors and finally to integrated circuits.
Most modern FM communications receivers use a phase locked loop
(PPL), a veritable workhorse in current electronics technology. The
PLL is also used in local oscillator stages of superheterodyne receivers
to provide precise frequencies and in FM modulator stages.
A deemphasis network is required to restore the original frequency
response of the audio (or data) modulating signals. For improved highfrequency response and reducing noise, the higher frequencies of the
audio modulating signal are boosted while the lower frequencies are
attenuated prior to transmission. A frequency-sensitive circuit is
needed in the receiver to restore the audio signal to its original condition. Thus a “copy” of the original audio signal is applied to the AF
amplifier. Virtually all amateur receivers (or the receive section of
transceivers) provide an audio jack for headphone use.
FM receivers usually include two important features to provide
clear and constant audio output signals. First, an automatic gain control (AGC) controls the gain of the RF and IF amplifiers to compensate
for varying signal levels from the antenna. The automatic frequency
control (AFC) control signal, generated by the FM detector stage, keeps
the local oscillator frequency at the proper frequency for optimum
reception.
Although not indicated by this general block diagram for FM
receivers, some communications receivers employ a second conversion stage to down-convert the 10.7-MHz IF signal to a frequency of
455 kHz. Then the 455 kHz IF amplifiers provide for narrow frequency
response, which eliminates any remaining image frequency problems
and adjacent interfering signals.

All about Transmission Lines
and Antennas
I

n the previous two chapters we covered transmitters and receivers
Now let us connect this equipment to a transmission line and
antenna. We will consider a systems approach because all of these
components must be properly matched for successful operation.
The transmission line is simply a device for conducting radio-frequency energy between the amateur transmitter or receiver and the
antenna. The distances between these two locations will vary depending on where the amateur operator can install the transmitter and
receiver and the antenna. At HF frequencies, losses in the transmission
line will be negligible at distances between 50 to 100 feet (about 150 to
300 meters). However, if we increase distance or operating frequency,
losses in the transmission line might degrade system operation.
In the transmit mode, the transmission line must be capable of
delivering many watts of RF energy from the transmitter to the antenna
with negligible loss. In most cases, the same antenna and transmission
line is used for both transmitting and receiving. During the receiving
mode, the transmission line must be able to deliver low-level RF signals of a few micromicrowatts with minimum attenuation. A loss in
the transmission line can push these small signals into the noise level,
making reception impossible.

Definitions
Antenna An antenna is a conductor or group of conductors used
for radiating RF energy into space or collecting radiated RF energy
from space. In general, any antenna used for transmitting can also be
used for receiving purposes.
Antenna input resistance The ideal antenna acts as a resonant
circuit and presents a pure resistance to the transmission line. In
practice, antennas usually exhibit inductive or capacitive reactance,
resulting in a complex impedance. One definition of this input
impedance is that it is equal to the voltage across the antenna terminals divided by the current flowing into the antenna. A related term
is radiation resistance. The ideal antenna accepts RF energy as if it
were a resistor connected across the end of the transmission line.
For example, a dipole antenna in free space has a radiation resistance of 73 ohms. To the transmission line, this appears as a 73-ohm
resistor.
Antenna tuner Sometimes called a transmatch or antenna matching unit, this device provides for matching the impedance of the transmission line to that of the transmitter or antenna. For example, an
antenna tuner can be used to match a 50-ohm transmitter to a 300-ohm
transmission line.
Balun A balun is a device for matching or connecting balanced
and unbalanced circuits. For example, a balun can be used to match a
coaxial cable (an unbalanced transmission line) to a dipole antenna (a
balanced electrical device).
Characteristic impedance As applied to transmission lines, this
term defines the input impedance characteristics. Characteristic
impedance is a function of the lumped inductance and capacitance
contained in the transmission line and is approximately equal to L/C.
It appears as a resistive element when the transmission line is properly
matched to the transmitter and antenna. The popular RG-8/U coaxial
cable has a characteristic impedance of 52 ohms.
Coaxial-cable transmission lines This type of transmission line
employs an outer conductor that surrounds an inner conductor. An
insulating material such as polyethylene separates the two conductors. The outer conductor is normally held at ground potential while
the inner conductor is considered as the “hot” lead. A coaxial cable is

Ch10_Laster_136187-1

12:52 PM

Page 325

ALL ABOUT TRANSMISSION LINES AND ANTENNAS

referred to as an unbalanced line. Typical coaxial cables used in amateur radio stations have a characteristic impedance of 50 to 75 ohms.
Dipole antenna The dipole antenna consists of two “poles” or conductors arranged in a straight line and separated at the center by an
insulator. The transmission line is connected to the center of the
dipole. A dipole antenna is normally one-half wavelength long from
end to end. Sometimes the dipole is called a center-fed Hertz antenna
or half-wave doublet antenna.
Electrical length The electrical length of an antenna is defined in
terms of wavelengths. A vertical antenna, for example, may have an
electrical length of one-quarter wavelength.
Harmonic operation Some antennas, such as the dipole, can be
used at an odd multiple of its operating frequency. For example, a 40meter dipole antenna will also perform as an antenna in the 15-meter
band. Note that 21 MHz is an odd (3rd) harmonic of 7 MHz. The use of
a 7-MHz doublet antenna at 21 MHz is called harmonic operation.
Multiband antenna A multiband antenna is one designed to operate on two or more bands of frequencies. For example, vertical antennas designed for operation on 80, 40, 20, 15, and 10 meters can be
purchased from commercial sources or constructed from antenna
designs available in amateur handbooks.
Single-wire transmission lines Used primarily to connect a longwire antenna to a receiver, this is simply a single-conductor transmission
line. It is not used with transmitters because it tends to act as a radiator
and presents a varying impedance if allowed to swing with the wind.
Standing waves These are essentially stationary waves of voltage
and current that might exist on a transmission line or antenna. Standing waves are useful in antennas because they produce maximum radiation of the RF signal. However, standing waves in a transmission line
are undesirable because they represent a mismatch of impedances.
This results in a portion of the RF energy delivered to the antenna
being reflected back to the transmitter.
Standing-wave ratio (SWR) This defines the ratio of the maximum
to minimum voltage or current levels in a transmission line. It is also
a function of the power delivered to the antenna and the power being
reflected back to the transmitter. An SWR bridge is a device for measuring the SWR of a transmission line connected between a transmitter and an antenna.

326 CHAPTER TEN
Vertical antenna In general, a vertical antenna consists of a vertically
positioned conductor, rod, or tower. A vertical quarter-wave antenna that
employs a ground plane is called a Marconi antenna. The ground plane
serves as a mirror, reflecting the radiated waves into space.

Transmission Line Basics
Let us consider the important role that the transmission line plays in the
amateur radio station. The function of the transmission line is to transfer RF energy between the transmitting/receiving equipment and the
antenna. Figure 10.1 illustrates a typical Technician amateur installation employing an HF transceiver, a 50-ohm coaxial transmission line,
and a half-wave doublet antenna. Antennas designed for operation on
the 80- to 10-meter bands can be used in this basic configuration.
We have a properly matched RF system in Fig. 10.1. The transmitter output impedance is adjusted to 50 ohms and matches into the 50ohm coaxial cable. At the antenna end, the 50-ohm cable matches the
50 ohms presented by the antenna. These conditions allow for maximum transfer of RF energy, both in transmit and receive modes of
operation. The half-wave doublet antenna shown in Fig. 10.1 is cut for
40-meter operation. However, antennas for any HF band can be substituted. Also, an arbitrary length of 100 feet was selected for the trans-

mission line. In practice, this length should be as short as possible to
reduce losses.

Types of Transmission Lines
Transmission lines come in a variety of types—single wire, parallel
two-wire open line, twin lead, twisted pair, and coaxial cable. This
discussion is limited to the more common types of transmission lines
used by most hams, twin-lead and coaxial lines. Figure 10.2 illustrates
these types of transmission lines. From top to bottom, Fig.
10.2 shows 300-ohm heavy-duty twin lead used for TV as well as amateur radio, 72-ohm parallel transmission line, RG-58A/U 50-ohm coaxial cable with UHF-type connector, and RG-8/U 50-ohm foam-type
coaxial cable.

Twin-lead lines
Twin-lead line, available with a characteristic impedance of 72 to 300
ohms, was originally developed for television receivers. This line consists
of two parallel conductors embedded in a thin ribbon of plastic or polyethylene material. Sometimes called ribbon-type TV cable, it generally
was not suitable for transmitting purposes. However, heavy-duty versions
with larger sizes of conductors are available for the amateur market.

Page 328

328 CHAPTER TEN
The twin-lead cable, a balanced form of transmission line, is used
with some special forms of antennas. However, twin-lead lines have
several limitations. Deposits of moisture and dirt on the line can change
the characteristic impedance, causing a mismatch and loss of efficiency.
The twin-lead line cannot be installed close to a metal surface, such as
being taped to the side of a tower. Again, this causes a change in the
characteristic impedance. The heavy-duty 72-ohm versions are less
affected by these limitations because the conductors are spaced closer
together to confine the electric field within the dielectric material.

Coaxial transmission lines
A coaxial line, or “coax” cable, is the most common type of transmission line used in amateur radio operations from HF to UHF frequencies. Coax, an unbalanced form of transmission line, consists of
an outer conductor surrounding an inner conductor. An insulating
material, usually polyethylene or polyfoam, is placed between the
conductors. The outer conductor, or braid, serves as a shield and is
normally held at ground potential. Figure 10.3 shows the construction used in a typical coaxial cable.
The major advantage of the coaxial line is that the RF field is contained within the outer conductor. Also, the outer insulating jacket is
virtually waterproof, permitting outdoor installation. These factors
allow coax transmission lines to be installed almost anywhere—taped
to towers, placed in metal pipes, or even run underground.
Coax cables are available in many sizes and characteristic impedances. Table 10.1 shows a group of the more common types of coaxial
cables used by hams. Attenuation factors have been converted to transmission efficiencies to illustrate how cable length affects line losses. For
example, if the transmission line and antenna in Fig. 10.1 is operated on
40 meters, the transmission efficiency is
approximately 90 percent. This means that

length and that the transmission line is matched to the antenna. For
example, an antenna too long or too short can cause additional loss of
power actually being radiated into space.) Reducing the line length to 50
feet (or 15 meters) will cut the power loss in the line to about 5 watts.
Both RG-8/U (52 ohms) and RG-11/U (75 ohms) are heavy-duty,
low-loss types of coaxial cable suitable for permanent, long-run installations. Figure 10.4 shows RG-8/U foam cable that is available in standard lengths up to 100 feet or more, with RF connectors installed. This
type of cable is highly resistant to all weather conditions and should
provide many years of service.
Lightweight, smaller coaxial cables, such as RG-58/U (52 ohms)
and RG-59/U (73 ohms), are more suitable for short cable runs (such as
mobile installations and portable operation) where the higher cable
losses are not important. Figure 10.4B shows RG-58/U, which is available in standard lengths with RF connectors installed.
An intermediate size cable, the RG-6, 75-ohm impedance, is adequate for many installations where small size and weight is required.

Standing Waves
The transmission line is said to be matched to the antenna when each
impedance is resistive and equal in value. For example, a 50-ohm transmission line connected to a 50-ohm antenna results in a maximum
transfer of RF power from the transmitter to the antenna. Thus properly
matched to the antenna, the transmission line exhibits a constant
impedance at any point along the line. This means that voltage and current amplitudes are constant throughout the line. However, if the
antenna is not constructed or adjusted for the required frequency of
operation, the antenna will not match properly to the transmission.
Extreme cases of mismatch occur when the antenna appears to be either
a short or an open circuit. Figure 10.5 shows voltage and current relationships (standing waves along the transmission line) for these two
extreme conditions. Note that the transmission line is approximately
one wavelength long.

Standing-wave ratios
An antenna that is not matched to the transmission line will cause standing waves to appear on the line. The ratio of maximum to minimum

332 CHAPTER TEN
THE MEANING OF SWR

Now that SWR has been defined, let’s see how it affects the performance of our radiating system.
Table 10.1 shows us that any transmission line, even when
properly matched, has some attenuation or loss. This loss is due
mostly to resistance in the conductors and power dissipated in the
dielectric.
The ideal SWR of a transmission line is 1 to 1. Any increase in SWR
results in additional power loss. For example, a mismatched antenna
causes power to be reflected back toward the transmitter. For high values
of SWR and large transmission-line losses, power lost in the system can
be greater than power radiated by the antenna.
In general, an SWR of 2 to 1 or less results in minimal loss in the
radiating system. When receiving a transmitted signal, you can barely
notice the difference between an SWR of 2 to 1 and that of 1 to 1.
STANDING-WAVE MEASUREMENTS

Standing-wave ratios can be measured with devices called SWR
bridges or SWR meters. You can purchase an SWR meter from most
amateur supply houses or build one from plans in ham publications
such as the ARRL Radio Amateur’s Handbook. Figure 10.6 shows a
commercial SWR meter that also measures output power levels. Many
SWR meters cover a frequency range of about 3 to 150 MHz and work
with either 50- or 75-ohm transmission lines.
These devices are particularly useful when installing and adjusting
antennas. To measure SWR, simply connect the SWR meter between
the transmitter and the transmission line as shown in Fig. 10.7.
Because SWR measurements require only a minimum amount of
power, you can make SWR measurements without causing interference to other ham operators. After an initial sensitivity adjustment, the
SWR can be read directly from the meter scale.

High-Frequency Antennas
The antenna is one of the most important elements in amateur operation. When transmitting, the antenna converts radio-frequency energy
into electromagnetic waves for radiation into space. For receiving, the
antenna collects electromagnetic waves and converts these waves into
electrical energy for input into the receiver. In general, the gain and

direction of maximum radiation (or maximum reception) depends on
the shape of the antenna.
Antennas used in amateur radio communications are available in
many types, sizes, and shapes. This discussion of amateur antennas is
limited to those types most suited for Technician operation, namely
the half-wave doublet, quarter-wave vertical, and the beam antenna.

Half-wave doublet (or dipole) antenna
Antenna operation involving the radiation and reception of RF signals
is an extremely complex process that engineers and scientists describe

in terms of mathematical analysis. However, we can employ some fundamental concepts that will help to explain how antennas work.
Because the half-wave dipole antenna is a basic form of an antenna, we
will use this as a starting point.
When a radio-frequency current flows in a dipole, electric and magnetic fields are generated along the antenna conductors or elements. If
the dipole antenna has a physical length of one-half wavelength, it acts
as a resonant circuit at half the wavelength frequency. Figure 10.8A
shows a half-wave dipole antenna connected to a transmitter through
a transmission line. The relationship between the physical length of a
half-wave antenna and the operating frequency is given by:

L is the length of the half-wave antenna in feet or meters

In theory, the length of a half-wave dipole is about 5 percent longer
than indicated by the above equations. However, additional loading
effects of insulators and supporting wires result in end effects. This
correction applies for wire-type antennas up to about 30 MHz.
When installed in free space, the half-wave dipole presents a pure
resistance of 73 ohms to the transmission line. Figure 10-8B shows
how the antenna appears to the transmission line and the transmitter.
This input resistance, sometimes called radiation resistance, of the
antenna is defined as the voltage applied to the antenna terminals
divided by the current flowing into the antenna.

336 CHAPTER TEN
The radio-frequency currents generated by the transmitter produce
standing waves of voltage and current along the length of the antenna. This
is illustrated in Fig. 10.8C. The voltage standing wave is highest at each
end and drops to zero at the center of the antenna. The current standing
wave is out of phase with the voltage wave and is a maximum at the center. The dipole is referred to as a center-fed device with current-feed characteristics. As stated earlier, the impedance or resistance at the center is 73
ohms—this value increases to about 2500 ohms at each end of the antenna.
The voltage and current standing waves produce alternating electric
and magnetic fields. These fields change direction during each cycle of
the RF current. Figure 10.8D shows orientation and direction of the alternating fields during one-half of an RF cycle.
Radiation of electromagnetic waves is created when the alternating
electric and magnetic fields attempt to collapse back toward the
antenna. However, new fields being created by the next half cycle push
the preceding fields into space, which is the mechanics of radiation.
LONG AND SHORT DIPOLES

If the dipole antenna is made longer or shorter than a half-wave length,
the input impedance no longer acts as a 73-ohm resistor. Instead, it
presents a complex impedance with inductive or capacitive loading
effects to the transmission line. Figure 10.9 illustrates the results and
corrective action when we cut the dipole too long or too short.
A dipole antenna whose length is greater than one-half wavelength
(but less than one wavelength) acts as an inductor in series with a
resistor. Capacitance can be added to shorten the electrical length to an
equivalent half wavelength. The capacitance cancels out the inductive
effect and the antenna appears purely resistive to the transmission
line. Of course, we can also correct for the inductive reactance by
shortening the antenna.
When the dipole antenna length is less than one-half wavelength,
the load presented to the transmission line appears as a capacitor in
series with a resistor. Adding inductors in each leg of the dipole cancels the capacitive effect, leaving only the resistive load. This is one
way that amateurs “tune” short antennas when space restrictions
prevent installation of half-wave dipoles. Vertical antennas can also
be made physically short if an inductive loading coil is installed in
the vertical element.

RADIATION PATTERNS FROM DIPOLE ANTENNAS

The radiation from a half-wave dipole is strongest on each side of the
axis of orientation and decreases to a minimum at the ends. Figure
10.10A shows a plot of the radiation pattern of a dipole from a view
looking down on the antenna. For example, if you desire an antenna
orientation with maximum radiation in a north-south direction, you
must install the antenna in an east-west line.
The radiation pattern of a dipole antenna changes when it is
installed above a ground surface. The ground acts as a mirror and
waves striking the ground will be reflected into space. To illustrate
this, Fig. 10.10B shows an end view of the radiation pattern of a dipole
antenna in free space.
If the dipole is installed about one-fourth wavelength above a good
conductive ground (damp or moist soil), high-angle radiation will be
created due to some of the waves being reflected by the ground. This
radiation pattern, shown in Fig. 10.10C, is useful for contacts on 80

and 40 meters out of about 200 miles (320 kilometers). However, this
high-angle radiation is not effective for long DX contacts.
In general, raising the dipole antenna higher above ground lowers
the radiation angle. Figure 10.10D shows the radiation pattern when
the antenna height is about one wavelength. This results in four distinct lobes, or maximum radiation angles. It should be noted that the
type and condition of the ground is important for it to act as a mirror
to radio waves. A heavy rain, for example, can raise the effective
ground level for an antenna, pushing up the angle of radiation.
RADIATION RESISTANCE CHANGES WITH ANTENNA HEIGHT

We stated earlier that the radiation resistance of a half-wave dipole in
free space is 73 ohms. Installing this antenna above a ground surface
will cause the radiation resistance to vary from about 95 ohms down to

Ch10_Laster_136187-1

12:52 PM

almost zero ohms. Figure 10.11 shows how the radiation resistance for
a half-wave dipole will vary with respect to its height above ground.
This graph can help you in selecting the type of transmission line to be
used with your antennas. In general, 75-ohm coaxial cable is suitable
for dipole or doublet antennas installed at heights of one-fourth wavelength or higher. Below heights of one-fourth wavelength, the 50-ohm
coaxial cable should be used.

doublet antenna. Also, you can pick up most of the coaxial cable and
antenna wire from swap-fests or auction nights at the local ham club.
Many of the experienced hams will be glad to help you install the antenna
or answer any questions you might have on parts or installation problems.

Safety and other considerations
Prior to any actual installation of antennas, poles, or tower work, you
should be aware of all related safety rules. The installation manual for
any new equipment, including antenna kits, will have safety instructions concerning installation and grounding procedures. Read these
carefully because they might save your life or the life of another person helping you with the installation. Additional suggestions for your
safety are as follows:
■ Connect all major electronic equipment (transmitter, receiver,

antenna tuner, and other components) with a ground terminal,
to a common ground. Chapter 11 provides additional information on this procedure.
■ When installing or working on an antenna mounted on a tower,

always use a safety belt to ensure maximum safety. While on the
tower, be sure that no power (RF or 60-Hz ac power) is applied
to antennas or other equipment on the tower. Battery-operated
tools, such as drills or soldering guns, are recommended instead
of 120-V ac operated tools.
■ People on the ground, helping with installers on the tower,

should wear protective items such as hard hats and safety
glasses. This will prevent falling objects from injuring the persons on the ground.
■ Never install an antenna close to an electric power line. During

installation, a wire or part of the tower could fall against the
power line and cause severe burns or fatal electric shock to people on or near the tower. After installation, there is always the
possibility that the power line might be blown or fall across the
antenna installation. This could result in dangerously high voltages being conducted inside the ham shack.

■ Install the antenna with as much clearance away from nearby

objects as possible. Trees, buildings, power or telephone lines,
or metal fences will distort the radiation pattern as well as
change the radiation resistance.
■ Cut the transmission line at the point where it enters the side of

the building and install PL-259 (or equivalent) coaxial connectors on each end. Using a PL-258 (or equivalent) coaxial coupler,
install a coaxial static discharge unit between the two ends of
the coaxial cable. Now connect a No. 12 bare copper ground
wire between the coaxial static discharge unit and a water pipe
or a ground rod.
The installation of the coaxial static discharge unit serves two
important functions. First it allows a discharge path for the buildup of
static electricity on the antenna wires. During electrical storms, this
electrical potential can build up to thousands of volts, possibly causing electrical shock to the operator or damage to the ham equipment.
The second reason for installing the coaxial static discharge unit is
that of protection against direct lightning striking the antenna. Sometimes, however, any protection short of disconnecting the antenna
from the ham equipment might not be effective against a direct lightning strike. The coaxial static discharge unit does not guarantee that
the lighting will not enter the ham shack—it only reduces the possibility of such an occurrence. During inactive periods or in case of an
impending storm, you are strongly urged to disconnect the coaxial
cable from the ham equipment. However, don’t do this during a
storm—a bolt of lightning could strike the antenna the instant you take
hold of the coaxial cable. In any event, never operate your ham rig during storm conditions.
In the event you do not have a space for installing a conventional
half-wave doublet, an inverted-vee antenna will do almost as well. An
inverted-vee consists of a half-wave doublet with one or both elements
slanted down toward the ground and the center section installed as high
as possible. A suggested inverted-vee antenna is shown in Fig. 10.13.
You can use a telescoping TV mast for the center section of the
inverted-vee antenna. This will provide a height of about 30 to 45 feet.
If the upper section of the mast is attached to the gable of your house,
this will reduce guying requirements. To prevent interaction of the guy

wires with the antenna, be sure to break up the guy wires into short
sections joined by insulators. Any section of guy wire should not be
greater than about one-eighth wavelength of the operating frequency.
Also, the angle between the “drooping” legs of the doublet should
never be less than 90 degrees. Otherwise, a smaller angle will cause
cancellation of the radio waves and less radiating efficiency. Install the
antenna with about 2 or 3 percent of additional wire on each end. The
added wire can be folded back from the insulator and wrapped around
the antenna wire. Having this extra length of wire will allow you to
“prune” the antenna to the desired frequency of operation.
To test and adjust the antenna, connect an SWR meter in the transmission line as shown in Fig. 10.7. It is a good idea to measure the
SWR over the antenna’s range of operation at about 10.kHz steps and
plot these readings on a graph. This shows you if the resonant frequency falls within the Technician portion of the band or if the
antenna is too long or too short. Figure 10.14 illustrates a typical set of
readings for each condition. Using the SWR approach requires that
you transmit a test signal for each SWR reading. If you are a Novice

operator, you are limited to emitting test signals within the Technician
bands. Also, remember that your test signal should be adjusted to the
lowest level possible so that you will not interfere with other amateurs
operating on the same frequencies. By plotting the SWR readings on a
graph you can get a rough indication of the antenna’s resonant frequency even though it may fall outside of the Technician band. This is
shown by the dotted lines on the graphs in Fig. 10.14.
Newer forms of SWR meters, designated as antenna analyzers, are
available that will let you check the performance of an antenna at any
frequency within the range of the antenna analyzer. This instrument
has a low-level internal oscillator along with the SWR circuitry, elim-

You merely connect the antenna analyzer to the antenna being tested,
tune the analyzer’s internal oscillator to the desired frequency, and
read the SWR on the analyzer’s meter.
If the resonant frequency does not fall within the desired band of
frequencies, the slope of the SWR plot indicates whether the antenna

is too long or too short. Vary the antenna length about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in the required direction and recheck the SWR readings. In
this manner you will be able to bring the resonant frequency of the
antenna to the desired frequency.
Some amateurs prefer to use an antenna-impedance bridge or noise
bridge for measuring antenna impedances and the resonant frequency.
Figure 10.16 shows a typical noise bridge that allows you to measure
the resistance and reactance (inductive or capacitive) characteristics of
an antenna at any frequency. This and similar noise bridge test instruments are powered by an attached battery. Because this type of device
does not require the use of a transmitter test signal, it affords portable
operation, even testing at the antenna input terminals. Furthermore,
the antenna noise bridge can be used by the Technician operator at frequencies outside of the Technician bands.
The antenna noise bridge shown in Fig. 10.16, called the R-X Noise
Bridge, is manufactured by Palomar Engineers. It consists of a noise
generator and a bridge circuit for measuring resistive, capacitive, and
inductive characteristics. An HF receiver is required as a detector for
the bridge circuit. When the R and XC-XL controls are adjusted for a
mull (minimum noise out of the receiver), their dial settings are read
directly in resistance and reactance.

Multiband antennas
Many types of multiband antennas, covering 80 through 10 meters, can
be purchased from commercial sources or built from designs available
in amateur publications. One simple form of an HF multiband antenna
for Technician operation is shown in Fig. 10.17. This antenna consists
of four separate doublets connected to a common coaxial transmission
line such as RG-8/U. For optimum operation, each doublet should be
installed in a straight line and separated in direction from the other
doublets. A dipole antenna center connector is used to connect the different dipoles to common connections. This connector allows the coaxial cable to be firmly attached to the antenna as well as providing a
means for hanging the antenna from a mast or other support.
The inverted-vee antenna can be adapted for multiband operation
using separate “drooping” dipoles connected to the common transmission line. Figure 10.18 shows how a typical three-band (80, 40, and
15 meters) inverted antenna can be installed in a minimum of space.
Another simple multiband antenna consists of a long wire connected
to an antenna tuner or transmatch. A simple long-wire antenna for 80
through 10 meters is shown in Fig. 10.19. This approach represents a

lengths of one wavelength or more produce
highly directional radiation patterns.
The antenna tuner is used to match the transmitter and transmission
line to the varying impedances of the long-wire antenna. As we switch
from one band to another, the impedance presented by the antenna
might shift to inductive or capacitive loading effects. The antenna
tuner “tunes” out these reactive effects by adding capacitance or inductance to the antenna circuit. One form of an antenna tuner, shown in
Fig. 10.20, consists of a variable inductor and capacitor. A commercial
antenna tuner is illustrated in Fig. 10.21. The more elaborate models
may contain a built-in SWR meter.

MFJ-971 allows you to match virtually all types of transmission lines to your amateur
HF transceiver, such as coaxial cables and even random lengths of wire. This antenna
tuner has a unique “Cross-Needle” SWR/watt meter with two switchable power ranges
of 30 and 300 watts.

350 CHAPTER TEN
Vertical antennas
The quarter-wavelength vertical antenna, sometimes referred to as a
Marconi antenna, provides good low-angle radiation for long-haul DX
contacts. It is also useful for installation in limited space. One disadvantage of the vertical antenna is that it does not provide as much gain
as the horizontal half-wave doublet. A simple quarter-wavelength vertical antenna is shown in Fig. 10.22.
The operation of the quarter-wavelength vertical antenna is similar
to that of the half-wave dipole because the ground plane reflects a mirror image of the vertical section. Voltage and current standing waves
for the vertical antenna are illustrated in Fig. 10.23.
For optimum operation, the vertical antenna must be installed on a
good conductive ground plane. If the vertical antenna is to be installed
on dry rocky soil, radial wires or conductors at least one-quarter wavelength long should be installed beneath the antenna. A minimum of
four radials should be used as the ground plane.
The radiation resistance of a quarter-wavelength vertical antenna
installed on a flat ground plane is about 30 ohms. An SWR of about 1.7
will be experienced if a 50-ohm coaxial transmission line is used. The
radiation resistance can be increased to about 50 ohms if a ground plane
consisting of four “drooping” radials is used. Each radial must be

slanted down at an angle of about 45 degrees. Figure 10.24 shows a practical design for a quarter-wavelength vertical antenna that can be used
for Technician operation. The basic design for this antenna can be found
in the ARRL Antenna Manual. Commercial vertical antennas for amateur operation are available from various sources. Figure 10.25 shows a
typical commercial amateur vertical antenna.
Many multiband vertical antennas use resonant traps for isolating
different sections to obtain the desired quarter-wavelength operation.
Figure 10.26 illustrates how a multiband vertical antenna can be constructed using traps. This type of antenna operates at optimum when
installed over a perfect conductive ground plane. Sometimes, many
radials are installed to achieve such a ground plane. The multiband vertical antenna is popular with hams who do not have space for installing
other forms of antennas. You can also use resonant traps in the construction of horizontal half-wave doublets. Many amateur publications
or antenna handbooks provide specific details for antenna construction.

Beam antennas
In general, amateur operation on bands up to and including 40
meters can be accomplished quite well using half-wave doublets or

quarter-wavelength verticals. The vertical angle of radiation and
polarization (vertical or horizontal) characteristics are relatively
unimportant on these bands. Above these bands, and particularly on
10 meters, many long-haul DX contacts cannot be made without
high-gain directional antennas. Fortunately, antenna structures are
smaller at these shorter wavelengths. This makes the construction
and installation of small rotatable antennas that can be pointed in the
desired direction of propagation practical.
Multiband beam or Yagi antennas with two or more elements are
commonly used by amateurs on the bands above 40 meters to obtain

Ch10_Laster_136187-1

high gain and directivity. By arranging a
series of elements in a plane as shown in
Fig. 10.27, an antenna array with high gain
and narrow beamwidth can be obtained.
An important advantage during reception
is that antenna gain is reduced off to the
sides and the back of the antenna. This
minimizes interference from signals in
other directions.
The beam or Yagi antenna provides
considerable gain over that of dipoles or
vertical antennas and is an excellent
antenna for DX contacts. The spacing
between elements is on the order of 0.15
to 0.2 wavelengths for maximum gain. A
simple transmission line is shown to
illustrate how this antenna is fed. In
actual practice, some form of impedance
matching device must be used to couple
the antenna to the transmission lines.

A typical four-element beam antenna is shown in Fig. 10.28. This
type of antenna provides excellent gain and directivity characteristics on 20, 15, and 10 meters. Note that this antenna uses resonant
traps to obtain multiband operation. Antennas of this type can easily
be installed on towers and rotated with antenna rotating systems.
The antenna shown in Fig. 10.28 provides a forward gain of 8.9 dB on
all specified bands and will handle up to 2 kilowatts of RF power.
The nominal input impedance is 50, ohms and cable such as RG-8/U
can be used to feed the antenna.

Station wiring diagrams
We have now covered transmitters, receivers, transmission lines, and
antennas. Next we examine station wiring diagrams. The FCC has a
number of questions that relate to station configurations. Every possible combination is not shown. Develop some of the required station
configurations yourself to help in the learning process!
Figure 10.29A shows a station consisting of a transmitter, receiver,
transmit-receive switch, transmission line, and an antenna. This is one
of the simplest configurations. If a transceiver is substituted for the
transmitter and receiver, then the transmit-receive switch is not
required as this function is built into the transceiver.
The addition of an SWR meter and an antenna tuner to the first configuration provides the operator with the capability to present a low
SWR to the transmitter. This equipment configuration is illustrated in
Fig. 10.29B.
The last configuration shows an amateur radio station with a transmitter, receiver, transmission line, antenna, transmit-receive switch,
grounding provisions, and a telegraph key. This is shown in Fig. 10.29C.

RF Radiation Safety and Radio
Communications Practices and
Procedures
T

his chapter provides a review of the required amateur radio communications practices and operating procedures. First, we will cover
the recent FCC Rules on RF Environmental Safety Practices, which
apply to three questions on the Technician Class Element 2 Examination. The next sections will provide information and recommendations for the design, installation, and operation of your amateur radio
station. The FCC expects you to know this material for the Technician
exam and subsequent operation of your amateur radio station (the
exam contains five questions on operating procedures). Understanding the material and related questions in the Technician Question Pool
(see Appendix A) is crucial to passing the Technician Examination,
Element 2!

Definitions
Ammeter The ammeter is an instrument (i.e., test equipment) for
measuring current flow (amperes) in an electrical circuit. It can be
designed to measure either ac or dc current.

358 CHAPTER ELEVEN
Average power The time-averaged rate of energy transfer.
Controlled environment For FCC purposes, this applies to human
exposure to RF radiation when people are exposed as a consequence of
their employment and after those who are exposed have been made
fully aware of the potential for exposure and can exercise control over
their exposure. This includes amateur radio operators and their immediate families.
Decibels (dB) A mathematical expression, decibels are equal to
ten times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of two power levels.
A complete description of decibels and how to calculate them is given
in Chap. 7. Decibel calculation is a convenient way to express the gain
(or loss) of amplifiers and small and large power, voltage, and current
levels.
Duty factor Applied to RF safety requirements, duty factor is
defined as a measure (or ratio) of the total time that an RF transmitter
is turned “on” (say 20 minutes) to the total observation time, usually
30 minutes. The duty factor in this observation period would be 20
minutes divided by 30 minutes, or 0.667. Note that a duty factor of 1.0
corresponds to continuous “on” operation of the transmitter.
Effective radiated power (ERP) Transmitted power being radiated
in a given direction. The ERP is equal to the RF power supplied to the
antenna multiplied by the antenna gain. Thus an RF transmitter providing 100 watts of power to an antenna with a gain of 5 will produce
an ERP of 500 watts in a given direction.
Exposure Exposure occurs whenever and wherever a person is
subjected to electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic fields produced by
a RF transmitter.
Far field That region of the antenna’s electromagnetic field, a
great distance from the antenna in terms of wavelengths, where the
wave front has a plane wave with uniform characteristics.
Gain (of an antenna) Usually expressed in decibels, the gain of
the subject antenna is determined by comparison with a “standard
antenna,” such as a half-wavelength dipole or an isotropic radiator.
General population/uncontrolled exposure For FCC purposes,
this applies to human exposure to RF fields when the general public is
exposed or when persons who are exposed as a consequence of their
employment may not be fully aware of the potential for exposure or
cannot exercise control over their exposure. Therefore, members of the

CH11_Laster_136187-1

12:53 PM

Page 359

RF RADIATION SAFETY AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

general public always fall under this category when exposure is
employment related.
Ground potential This is described as a zero voltage potential
with respect to ground or earth.
Ground rod A ground rod may be either a metal pipe or a rod driven into the ground for an electrical connection with the earth. A
buried cold-water (metallic only) pipe usually makes an excellent
ground connection.
Harmonic radiation This is defined as unintentional radiation of
signals whose frequencies are harmonics or multiples of the fundamental operating frequency.
Interference In terms of radio communications, interference is
the reception of undesired signals that interferes with the reception of
desired signals. Radio signals may also interfere with the performance
of other electronic equipment, such as audio systems.
Interfering signals present in the broadcast bands are called broadcast interference (BCI).
Interfering signals in the television bands are called television
interference (TVI).
Low-pass filter A low-pass filter passes all signal frequencies
below a critical frequency and reflects higher frequency signals. Some
amateurs use a low-pass filter between the transmitter and transmission line to prevent radiation of harmonic or spurious signals above 10
meters. This is an effective way of eliminating TVI.
Maximum permissible exposure (MPE) The maximum permissible electromagnetic field adjacent to the antenna that a person may be
exposed to without harmful effects and with an acceptable safety factor. It is to be noted that all amateur transmitters having a maximum
power output of 50 watts or less require only a routine evaluation for
RF safety. This means that as a rule, a transmitter output of 50 watts or
less will pose no threat to the amateur or nearby persons.
Near field The region adjacent to the antenna and nearby structures where the electromagnetic fields are the most intense and
nonuniform. For most antennas, the near-field boundary is estimated
to be about one-half wavelength from the antenna.
Ohmmeter The ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring resistance (in ohms). The electrical power to a circuit must be turned off
during all resistance measurements.

360 CHAPTER ELEVEN
Peak envelope power (PEP) This is the average power supplied to
the antenna transmission line by a radio transmitter during one
radiofrequency cycle at the crest of the modulation envelope taken
under normal operating conditions.
Plate circuit This term is normally used to describe the external
circuit that is connected to the plate and cathode terminals of a vacuum
tube. The FCC refers to the “amplifier plate circuit” when describing
the plate and cathode connections to the final RF amplifier stage of a
tube-type transmitter or external tube-type RF power amplifier.
Power density (S) The instantaneous power density integrated
over a source repetition period.
Public service operation Amateurs provide a valuable public service in terms of a voluntary noncommercial communications service,
particularly with respect to emergency communications.
Q signals This consists of a set of international abbreviated signals used primarily in Morse code communications. Each Q signal is a
three-letter group starting with the letter Q. For example, QTH means
“my location is —.” If followed by a question mark, the Q signal is a
question. For example, QTH? would be translated as “what is your
location?”
RST reporting system This is a signal-quality reporting system
used by amateurs and other communications activities. RST stands for
readability, strength, and tone. Numerals are used to indicate the quality of each characteristic, with scales of 0 to 5 for readability and 0 to
9 for both strength and tone. For example, a signal report of 5-9-9
means the received signal is “perfectly readable,” an “extremely strong
signal,” and a “perfect tone.”
Specific absorption rate (SAR) This is a measurement of the rate
of energy being absorbed by (or dissipated in) an incremental mass
contained in a volume element of dielectric material, such as biological tissues. SAR is usually expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg) or
milliwatts per gram.
Thermal effects As with microwave ovens, RF radiation at the
lower frequencies can produce heating effects within biological tissue.
If severe, this heating could have adverse effects.
Universal coordinated time (UTC) This is a worldwide system of
keeping time. The National Bureau of Standards standard time and frequency broadcast stations, WWV and WWVH, broadcast time signals

CH11_Laster_136187-1

based on the UTC time system. The specific hour and minute stated is
actually the time zone centered around Greenwich, England. This time
system is based on a 24-hour system—the hours are numbered beginning with 00 hours at midnight to 23 hours, 59 minutes just before the
next midnight. For example, 12 hours would be noon and 18 hours
would be 6:00 pm.
Voltmeter The voltmeter is an instrument for measuring voltage
(volts) or differences of potential. Voltmeters may be designed to measure ac or dc voltages.
Wattmeter This is an instrument for measuring the electrical
power being delivered to a circuit and is usually calibrated in units of
watts or kilowatts. Wattmeters are available for measuring ac or dc
power. For example, an RF wattmeter can be connected in the transmission line between the transmitter and the antenna in order to measure the amount of RF power being delivered to the antenna.

Radio Frequency Environmental Safely Practices
FCC rules and regulations require every amateur radio operator to
evaluate the RF environment surrounding his or her amateur station
and antenna installations. You must insure that all persons in the
vicinity of your station are not exposed to excessive RF radiation. Here
the FCC identifies two categories. The first or immediate group,
including the amateur operator, the amateur’s family, and other persons who are aware of the RF radiation, are in a Controlled Environment. An Uncontrolled Environment is the area around the amateur
station where persons, unaware of the RF radiation, may be present.
Persons in this category include neighbors and the general public.
Excessive RF radiation is defined by the FCC in terms of Maximum
Permissible Exposure (MPE). If a preliminary evaluation indicates that
your antennas are producing RF electromagnetic fields in excess of the
FCC limits, you must take immediate action to correct this potential
hazard. Simple steps such as reducing the RF power output of your
transmitter(s) to recommended levels or elevating the antennas and
installing them away from buildings may be the best solution.
In general, amateur radio is a relatively safe hobby in terms of RF
radiation hazards. The typical amateur radio transmitter power levels
rarely exceed the FCC radiated power limits. Again, sometimes all that

361

CH11_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:53 PM

362 CHAPTER ELEVEN
may be needed is to reduce the power level. It is to be noted here that
the FCC requires the amateur radio operator to operate with the minimum power required to successfully complete a contact. Why use 100
watts of RF power when 5 watts may be sufficient when contacting a
nearby amateur on a VHF repeater?
Considerable research by the FCC and other organizations has been
conducted on human exposure to RF electromagnetic radiation. Two
important findings of this research are as follows:
1. High levels of thermal or heating effects of RF radiation can cause
serious heat damage to biological tissue. The magnitude of these
heating effects will vary with the frequency (and wavelength),
power density, and propagation factors of the radiation field. Also,
the physical size or height of a person can create a “natural resonance” which causes maximum heating effects. These resonant
effects are most dominant in the 30- to 300-MHz frequency range.
Individual body parts such as the head will resonate at frequencies
about 400 MHz, and eyes will resonate at certain microwave frequencies. For example, excessive RF heating effects in the human
eye may cause cataracts to form.
2. Nonthermal or nonheating RF radiation, usually associated with
low-level RF and low-frequency energy fields, may have some biological effect on living beings, such as humans and animals. This
includes ac (60 Hz) power-line radiation. Long-term statistical studies have produced no definite link between this radiation and any
health problems. We can expect considerable research in the future
concerning the effects of RF radiation on humans and animals.
The applicable FCC documents concerning RF safety are the FCC
Part 1 and Office of Engineering and Technology (ORT) Bulletin 65.
You may want to obtain a copy of ORT Bulletin 65, “Evaluating Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radiofrequency
Electromagnetic Fields.” This bulletin provides a summary of the
FCC limits for maximum permissible exposure (MPE) in reference to
specific frequencies. Table 11.1, provided in OET Bulletin 65, shows
these MPE values for two conditions, Occupational/Controlled Exposure and General Population/Uncontrolled Exposure. The key to this

Note 1: Occupational/controlled limits apply in situations in which persons are exposed as a consequence
of their employment provided those persons are fully aware of the potential for exposure and can exercise control over their exposure. Limits for occupational/controlled exposure also apply in situations
when an individual is transient through a location where occupational/controlled limits apply provided
he or she is made aware of the potential for exposure.
Note 2: General population/uncontrolled exposures apply in situations in which the general public may be
exposed, or in which persons that are exposed as a consequence of their employment may not be fully
aware of the potential for exposure or can not exercise control over their exposure.

table contains the maximum power density in mW/cm2 (milliwatts
per square centimeter). Prior research determined the whole body’s
specific absorption rate (SAR), the value on which the MPEs are
based.
Figure 11.1 incorporates the data given in Table 11.1 to provide a
graphical representation of the MPE limits in terms of a plane-wave
equivalent power density. Both types of environments are given, i.e.,
the Occupational/Controlled Exposure and the General Population/
Uncontrolled Exposure. Both Table 11.1 and Fig. 11.1 show the following conclusions:
1. The human body absorbs energy differently at various frequencies.
The most stringent frequency band for RF radiation exposure is that
of the 30 to 300 MHz (VHF). Human body resonance effects occur
in this region.

FIGURE 11.1

RF RADIATION SAFETY AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

2. Regarding the microwave region (about 1500 MHz and above),
intense RF radiation in these frequencies can cause severe heating
in human biological tissues. In particular, the eye’s resonant frequency is highly susceptible to microwaves. The heating effect in
the ocular fluids can cause cataracts. This is one reason that you
should never look into the open end of a microwave feed horn
antenna when the transmitter is operating!
3. The FCC’s limits for maximum permissible exposure show that any
radiation tests must cover specified periods of time. In order to
determine compliance with the MPE levels, safe exposure levels for
RF energy are averaged as follows:
RF test environment

Time period

Uncontrolled RF Environment

30 minutes

Controlled RF Environment

6 minutes

Determining Compliance with FCC RF Safety Rules and
Regulations
Every amateur radio operator must determine if his or her amateur
radio station is in compliance with the FCC RF safety requirements.
Even the applicant for an amateur license must indicate his or her
understanding of these requirements on an amateur radio license
application form at the time of application. As stated earlier, there will
be three questions concerning this on your Technician license examination. By learning this RF safety material now, you will be prepared
both for the Technician exam and subsequent operation of your ham
station.
To evaluate compliance with the FCC rules, the first step is to determine the RF power output of your transmitter(s) or transceiver(s). Part
97.13 states that you must perform the routine RF evaluation if the RF
power output of your station exceeds the limits given in Table 11.1.
That’s right! You don’t need to perform any further evaluation as long
as you don’t exceed these RF power limits. As an example, you have

Note: This table covered in Part 97.13, shows the maximum RF
opersting power limit of an amateur radio station unless the
amateur operator performs a routine RF environmental evaluation as specified by the FCC.

100 watts output, Table 11.2 shows that
you are well within the RF output limits
for these two bands.
If your station RF power output
exceeds the power limits in Table 11.1,
you must perform a routine RF environmental evaluation in accordance with FCC
rules and regulations. Remember, the purpose of this evaluation is to ensure a safe
operating environment for amateurs, their
families, and their neighbors.
This evaluation can be performed using
one of three methods: direct power density
measurements, mathematical calculations,
or using reference tables. The first two of
these techniques are generally beyond the
capability of the average amateur operator.
For example, the complex test equipment is
too expensive for most amateurs. Also, considerable skill and technical knowledge are
required for making and interpreting power
density measurements. The second technique involves predicting the theoretical
power density by applying mathematical
equations for “near-field” and “far-field”
electromagnetic field power intensities.
These equations take into account the
antenna gain, which varies with the type of
antenna being used.
The far-field equation predicts the
value of the power density at a distant
point given the power input to the antenna
and the gain of the antenna:
S

PG
mW/cm
4R2

(Eq. 11.1)

where
S is the power density in milliwatts per square centimeter

CH11_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:53 PM

Page 367

RF RADIATION SAFETY AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

P is the input power to the antenna in watts
G is the antenna gain
R is the distance in centimeters
Stated in another way, “In the far field, as the distances from the
source increases, the power density is proportional to the inverse
square of the distance.”
The calculation of power density in the near field is complex due
to the particular antenna being used. Equation 11.1 will provide an
“overprediction” but could be used in a “worst-case” or conservative
prediction. Stated in terms of field strength, “In the near field, the field
strength depends on the type of antenna used.”
The W5YI RF Safety Tables, given in Appendix B, provide a convenient and fast means for determining if your station is within the MPE
guidelines established by the FCC. These tables provide safe distances
from your antenna for both controlled and uncontrolled environments
in terms of frequency and power levels.

General RF safety recommendations
The material up to this point covers most of the RF safety questions in
the Technician Examination Pool in Appendix A. Some additional
items are provided to cover the remaining examination questions as
well as important aspects of RF safety guidelines.
ADDING A NEW ANTENNA TO AN EXISTING ANTENNA “FARM”

When a new antenna is added to a group of antennas, such as multiple
repeated antennas on top of a building, the new repeater signal must
be considered as part of the total radiation from the site when determining RF radiation exposure levels.
RF SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS FOR USING A HAND-HELD
TRANSCEIVER

You should make sure that the antenna is not held too close during
transmission. The antenna should be positioned away from your head
and away from others.
PRECAUTIONS FOR INSTALLING TRANSMITTING ANTENNAS

Highly directional antennas such as VHF and UHF Yagi beam antennas should be installed in a location where no one can get close to

367

CH11_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:53 PM

Page 368

368 CHAPTER ELEVEN
them while you are transmitting. Any transmitting antenna, including
wire antennas, should be located so that no one can touch them while
you are transmitting. This touching may cause RF burns.
PRECAUTIONS FOR INSTALLING MOBILE ANTENNAS ON
VEHICLES

For the lowest RF radiation exposure to occupants inside the vehicle,
mobile antennas should be installed in the roof of the vehicle. When
this type of antenna is mounted on the metallic vehicle roof, the
mobile transceiver will generally produce less RF radiation exposure
than hand-held transceivers used inside the vehicle.
PRECAUTIONS FOR REMOVING THE SHIELDING COVER OF A UHF
AMPLIFIER

If the shielding cover of a UHF power amplifier is removed, make sure
the amplifier cannot be turned on. In general, all RF power amplifiers
should never be operated unless the covers are in place. This precaution will help reduce the risk of shock from high voltages and reduce
RF radiation exposure.

Radio Communications Practices
Good communications practices for an amateur radio station include
the following related items: properly installed equipment and antennas with adequate grounding, use of filters and shielding when
required to eliminate interference, proper use of test equipment,
proper tuning and adjustment of transmitters, protection against lightning, good safety practices, and good operating procedures. Note that
actions in one area might affect other areas. For example, safety is
directly related to all other areas.
You can develop good communications practices for your amateur
station only by diligent study and careful planning. A job well done
results in a sense of achievement and self-satisfaction.

Station installation
Planning an amateur station involves a variety of actions. By this time
you might have decided what type of equipment and antennas are best

CH11_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:53 PM

Page 369

RF RADIATION SAFETY AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

suited for your needs. Now you have to find a space for the ham shack
and the antennas. To get started, develop an installation plan that
identifies the general layout and the required installation material. By
the time you receive your license, you will be ready to get on the air
with a minimum of effort.

Station layout
Select a location for the ham shack that will provide space for a comfortable operation position. A large table is ideal for locating the
receiver, transmitter, key, and other equipment you might have
decided upon. Be sure to leave plenty of room for operating the key,
writing traffic on a pad of paper, and storage of log books.
If you have to locate the ham station in a small space, you can
install a shelf over a small table to hold most of the equipment. Figure 11.2 shows a typical layout with the receiver located on the

table and the remaining equipment installed on the shelf. Because
most operation involves tuning the receiver, it is convenient to
have the receiver within easy reach. Many variations of this type of
installation can be developed to meet your particular needs. Some
amateurs have designed elaborate operating consoles for their ham
stations.
Keep in mind that personal safety is a major factor is designing the
station layout. This applies to the operator as well as any visitors to the
ham shack. Being able to lock the entrance to the ham shack is a good
idea, especially to keep out small children when you are away.

Station wiring
Make sure that you have adequate wiring to handle the required ac
power for the ham shack. All power lines should be properly fused to
protect against short circuits in the equipment. In addition, each piece
of equipment should be individually fused to prevent internal shorts
from causing a fire hazard or damage to the equipment. The use of
three-conductor power cords with a ground connection will help to
ensure safety in the ham shack.
It is a good idea to install all station wiring in hidden or concealed
locations to prevent physical contact with the wiring or possible damage to the wiring. This also results in a neat and professional appearance to your ham shack.
A station ground is a must for both personal safety and proper operation of the amateur equipment. Be sure that all equipment in the ham
shack is connected to a common ground with a heavy conductor such as
No. 10 or 12 AWG wire. A buried water pipe makes an excellent earth
ground. In the absence of a water pipe, drive a copper ground rod about
6 to 8 feet into the ground. If you have a tower installed next to the ham
shack, you can also use the ground rod to ground the tower as well as
the station equipment. Grounding wire, rods, and special connectors
can be obtained at a local electrical supply house, electronics parts supplier, or hardware store.
One final recommendation—design your station wiring so that all
equipment can be disconnected from the ac power lines and antennas
with a minimum of effort. This helps to eliminate safety hazards or
unauthorized operation during your absence. In addition, this capability offers excellent protection against lightning damage.

RF RADIATION SAFETY AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI)
Many radio amateurs are blamed for causing interference to nearby
radios, television sets, or audio systems. In some cases, the amateur’s
transmitter or transceiver can be radiating harmonic or spurious signals that interfere with the operation of these home-entertainment systems. However, studies to date have shown that most cases of
interference can be traced to design or construction deficiencies inherent in these home-entertainment systems. For example, a television set
with poor selectivity in the tuner section can allow amateur signals to
enter the set and cause interference. Unfortunately, this type of situation does not relieve the amateur of some responsibility in trying to
help resolve the problem.
When confronted with a radio-frequency interference (RFI) complaint, there are a number of actions that you can take to solve the
problem. If you are a newcomer to amateur radio with no experience
in RFI problems, you can often contact a local ham radio club for
advice and assistance. Almost every ham club has a “TVI committee”
that offers technical assistance in tracking down RFI problems by
checking your rig and the neighbor’s radio, TV set, or audio system. In
addition, most radio clubs are affiliated with the American Radio
Relay League, Newington, Connecticut 06111. This organization
maintains extensive information and technical expertise on amateur
matters such as RFI and provides this service upon request. The ARRL
Radio Amateur’s Handbook contains detailed information on RFI
problems and recommended solutions.
The first step in clearing up an RFI complaint is to check your
transmitter or transceiver for RFI emissions. For BCI or TVI problems,
you can check for interference with any available AM radio or TV set.
If you find evidence of interference radiations, take immediate action
to clear up the problem. If no interference exists, you might want to
demonstrate this finding to your neighbor.

Elimination of RFI
Most modern amateur transmitters and transceivers are designed to suppress harmonic or spurious radiation. However, improper adjustment of
the operating controls can result in RFI emissions. In other cases, poor

371

CH11_Laster_136187-1

12:53 PM

372 CHAPTER ELEVEN
grounds or lack of grounding can cause RFI problems. These types of
problems can be quickly cleared up with a minimum of effort.
Some older or home-built amateur transmitters can radiate harmonic
or spurious signals, thereby causing interference problems. Internal
modifications such as shielding the high-power stages or installing
bypass capacitors can clear up these problems. This type of effort
requires considerable patience and a technical expertise. An alternate
solution is to determine if a low-pass RF filter will eliminate the interfering signals. A number of companies offer high-quality RF filters for
amateur operation. For example, the Barker & Williamson Company, 10
Canal Street, Bristol, PA 19007 [Telephone: (215) 788-5581], offers a complete line of radio-frequency filters for the amateur station. The B&W
Series FL10 Low Pass TVI Filters for 160–10 meters and FL6 Filters for 6
meters are available in either 100 or 1000 watt power capacity ratings.
Most of these filters are designed for 52-ohm transmission lines; however, the FL10/1500/70 works with 72-ohm transmission lines. Figure
11.3 shows how these filters can be installed.
Sometimes a TVI problem can be cleared up by installing a highpass RF filter at the antenna terminals of the TV set. This type of filter
allows the higher frequency TV signals to pass unattenuated into the
TV set while rejecting the lower frequency amateur signals. The Radio
Shack TV Interference Filter, Catalog No. 15-582, is typical of these
types of filters.
In general, interference to audio systems can only be corrected by
installing filter devices on the audio equipment. In some cases, the
interconnecting audio cables, particularly long unshielded speaker
wires, act as antennas. As such, the audio or hi-fi system simply operates as an untuned shortwave receiver, picking up any strong radiated
signals in the vicinity. Some manufacturers of these systems will pro-

vide modification kits to correct this type of problem. Installation of
RF bypass capacitors (about 0.001 µF) on input and output terminals
will usually clear up this type of interference. In some cases, the
speaker wires might require shielding with the shield connected to the
equipment ground.

How to Use Test Equipment
An important part of amateur radio is knowing when and how to use
test equipment. Technical manuals furnished with amateur radio
equipment usually include dc operating voltage and resistance measurements. This information is helpful in locating defective components or in making adjustments for proper operation. With simple test
equipment such as voltmeters or ohmmeters, you can quickly learn to
isolate defective components and repair your ham rigs.
This discussion of test equipment concentrates on the four basic
instruments: the ammeter, voltmeter, ohmmeter, and wattmeter. The
FCC expects you to be familiar with these basic instruments for both
the Technician examination and subsequent operation of your ham
station. As you progress in your career of amateur radio, you will come
into contact with more complex forms of test equipment, such as signal generators, frequency counters, and oscilloscopes. By developing a
good knowledge of the four basic test instruments listed above, you
will be prepared to understand and use the more advanced types of
test equipment. Many amateur publications contain descriptions of
this test equipment and how to use it.

Meter movements
The D’Arsonval meter movement is used in virtually all test equipment employing meters. This meter movement consists of a horseshoe-shaped magnet with a moving coil placed between the open ends
of the magnet. A pointer and spring is attached to the moving coil to
establish a zero reference point. When a dc current flows through the
coil, the magnetic field produced by this current interacts with the
fixed magnetic field produced by the magnet. This causes the moving
coil to rotate, and the amount of rotation is proportional to the current
flowing in the coil. Thus the D’Arsonval meter movement is used to
measure the amount of current flow. In the proper type of circuit, the

connected in a circuit. Note that the circuit
must be broken and the ammeter connected in series to form a completed
electrical path. As connected, the ammeter measures current flowing in
the collector circuit through Q12, R22, and R23. Never connect an
ammeter across a source of voltage or potential difference, such as a battery or resistor. This can damage or burn out the ammeter.
Ammeters are available in many types, sizes, and current ranges.
Typical dc ammeters used with amateur equipment include current
ranges of 0–50 µA, 0–1 mA, 0–200 mA, and 0–1 ampere. Most ac ammeters are rated in terms of frequency response or frequency of operation.
For example, a 0–100-mA ac ammeter designed for 60-Hz power line
measurements cannot be used to measure current at RF frequencies.


Voltmeters
Voltmeters are used to measure voltage or potential differences in electrical circuits. Unlike the ammeter, the voltmeter must be placed
across the component or source of voltage to make the required measurement. Voltage measurements are illustrated in Fig. 11.5.

also provided. The mobile transceiver output power is 5–50 watts for VHF and 5–35 watts for UHF operation. The many operating features include FM repeater operation and 9600 bps (bits per second) packet
radio with direct connections to an external packet modem.

A simple dc voltmeter consists of a dc
ammeter in series with a resistor, as shown
in Fig. 11.7. The sensitivity of the meter
(current range) and the value of the series
resistor determine the range of voltage that
can be measured. For operation as a voltmeter, the meter scale is calibrated in volts
instead of current.
The value of the series resistor for a
given voltage range can be calculated as

wired into a circuit. Any voltage
applied across an ohmmeter can damage the instrument. Also, the resistance
measurement will probably be in error
because an external voltage will affect
the operation of the ohmmeter.

FIGURE 11.8
Typical use of an ohmmeter.

■ It might be necessary to remove a component from a circuit

before measuring its resistance. Other components in parallel
with it might lower the resistance “seen” by the ohmmeter. In
most cases, you can simply disconnect one side of the component and take the resistance reading.
■ Semiconductor devices such as diodes and transistors will show a

greater resistance in one direction than in the opposite direction.
Therefore, by reversing the leads of the ohmmeter, you can often
determine if the device is defective.
In its simplest form, the ohmmeter consists of an ammeter in series
with a resistor and a battery. Figure 11.9 shows a simple ohmmeter. With

a short circuit connected across the test probes, the zero adjust control is
adjusted for a full-scale reading on the ammeter. Thus, when a resistance
is connected across the test probes, the ammeter reading will correspond
to a known value of resistance. If the ammeter scale is calibrated in ohms,
the value of the unknown resistor can be read directly.

The multimeter
One of the most versatile pieces of test equipment, the multitester (or
multimeter) can be used to measure voltages, current, resistance, and
in some instances, other electrical quantities. For example, the Radio
Shack Model 22-220 10-megohm FET-Input Multitester in Figure
11.10A can be used to measure dc and ac voltage levels to 1000 volts
in seven ranges with a 10-megohm input resistance. This multitester,
also known as a volt-ohmmeter, measures dc current up to 10 amperes,
resistance up to 100 megohms, and five ranges of decibels from –20 to
+62 dB voltage levels.
A more recent form of multitester, the digital multimeter, is rapidly
becoming a popular test instrument. The Radio Shack Model 22-174
Handheld True RMS Autoranging/Manual LCD Digital Multimeter,
shown in Figure 11.10B is an example of this new generation of multitesters. This test instrument measures dc and ac voltages, dc and ac current, frequency up to 4 MHz, dBm levels, capacitance from 4 nF to 400
F, transistor gain, audible continuity buzzer, and even a temperature
probe with C/F scales.

Wattmeters
Wattmeters are used to measure power delivered to a load. Amateurs use
RF wattmeters to measure the RF power delivered from a transmitter to
the transmission line. Some RF wattmeters contain an SWR (standingwave ratio) meter for measuring both forward and reflected power. Figure
8.15 in Chap. 8 shows a typical RF wattmeter suitable for amateur use.

Operating Procedures
Finally, after passing the Technician examination and completing the
installation of your amateur station, you are ready to begin operation. But
first, you need to learn the basic principles of good operating procedures
for successful and rewarding operation of that new ham rig. To avoid mass

confusion on the amateur bands, all hams use a common and efficient set of
operating procedures that have been developed over the years. Each FCC
Technician examination includes several questions covering this subject.

Operating courtesy
Before attempting to establish a QSO (communication) with another
amateur, be sure you have tuned the transmitter for proper operation.

CH11_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:53 PM

Page 379

RF RADIATION SAFETY AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

To avoid excessive tune-up time on the air (you might cause interference to an ongoing communication) use a dummy load for initial tuneup procedures. Check for activity on the desired frequency before
tuning up the transmitter on-the-air. If necessary, shift up or down a
few kHz to avoid causing interference to other hams.
In any communication with another amateur radio station, always zero
beat your signal with the incoming signal from the other station. This
ensures a more reliable contact; equally important, you and the other amateur radio station will be occupying less frequency spectrum. In today’s
crowded bands, this can make a difference in a successful contact.
Before sending out your first CQ, listen on the desired operating frequency to determine if it is already in use. If you attempt to use a frequency with a QSO in progress, the odds are that you are wasting your
time as well as interfering with the other parties in communication.
Remember, you have to share the amateur bands with many other hams.
Sometimes it is better to listen for someone calling CQ. Using this
approach, you avoid interference to other hams and gain valuable experience in how to establish contacts. With a few QSOs under your belt,
you will feel more confident in calling CQ.
One last item in operating courtesy—don’t try to show off your code
proficiency by sending too fast. If you want to make solid contacts, send
your transmissions at a rate that can be copied by the distant ham. If he
or she is transmitting at a rate too fast for good copy, send a QRS on your
next transmission. This tells the person to slow down.

CW or telegraph procedures
Hams use an abbreviated language for CW operation to expedite communications. This universal language allows you to communicate
with other hams regardless of country or nationality.
There are three parts to this language: Q signals that state or request
specific information; the RST signal reporting system for exchanging
information on signal quality; and standard abbreviations. With a little
effort, you can quickly learn enough of this new language to pass the
Technician examination. After a few months of operating experience,
you will pick up the remaining parts.

Q signals
Q signals are always sent as a group of three letters that begin with the letter Q. Each Q signal has a particular meaning that is recognized by hams

379

CH11_Laster_136187-1

9/25/01

12:53 PM

Page 380

380 CHAPTER ELEVEN
across the world. For example, QRN means “I am being troubled by static.” If the Q signal is followed by a question mark (?), it is a query to the
distant operator. QRN? asks “Are you being troubled by static?”
Table 11.3 lists most of the more common Q signals used in amateur radio communications and in the FCC Technician examination. A
complete listing of all international Q signals as well as other operating aids can be found in the ARRL Handbook For Radio Amateurs.

The RST signal-reporting system
Amateurs use this signal-reporting system to describe the signal readability, strength, and tone characteristics of the received signal. In many
instances, you will want to know how your signal is being received by a
distant ham. By sending only three numbers, he or she can give you a
complete signal report. The RST system is given in Table 11.4.

Prosigns and standard abbreviations
The final part of this new and exciting language used by CW operators is
that of prosigns (procedural signs) and standard abbreviations. Most of
these CW terms, required by regulations, help you to minimize the keying required to communicate with distant hams. Table 11.5 lists the more
common prosigns and standard abbreviations you should know for the
FCC examination and subsequent operation on the ham bands. The lines
above the prosigns mean that there is no spacing between the characters.

A Typical Contact on the Novice Bands
The following series of messages illustrate how you can use CW transmissions to converse with other hams. In actual CW communications
you would probably stay on the air for a much longer period of time,
exchanging much information with the other operator. Also, you
might want to use more or fewer abbreviations with longer or shorter
sentences. Refer to Tables 11.3, 11.4, and 11.5 to determine the full
meaning of this short series of messages.

APPENDIX

The W5YI RF Safety Tables*

here are two ways to determine whether your station’s radio frequency signal radiation is within the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) guidelines established by the FCC for controlled and
uncontrolled environments. One way is direct measurement of the RF
fields. The second way is through prediction using various antenna
modeling, equations, and calculation methods described in the FCC’s
OET Bulletin 65 and Supplement B.
In general, most amateurs will not have access to the appropriate calibrated equipment to make precise field strength/power density measurements. The field-strength meters in common use by amateur operators
and inexpensive, hand-peld field-strength meters do not provide the
accuracy necessary for reliable measurements, especially when different
frequencies may be encountered at a given measurement location. It is
more practical for amateurs to determine their pep output power at the
antenna and then look up the required distances to the controlled/uncontrolled environments using the following tables, which were developed
using the prediction equations supplied by the FCC.
The FCC has determined that radio operators and their families are
in the controlled environment and your neighbors and passers-by are
in the uncontrolled environment. The estimated minimum compliance
distances are in meters from the transmitting antenna to either the
occupational/controlled exposure environment (Con) or the general
population/uncontrolled exposure environment (Unc) using typical

antenna gains for the amateur service and assuming 100% duty cycle
and maximum surface reflection. Therefore, these charts represent the
worst-case scenario. They do not take into consideration compliance
distance reductions that would be caused by:
1. Feed line losses, which reduce power output at the antenna, especially at the VHF and higher frequency levels.
2. Duty cycle caused by the emission type. The emission-type factor
accounts for the fact that, for some modulated emission types that
have a nonconstant envelope, the pep can be considerably larger than
the average power. Multiply the distances by 0.4 if you are using CW
Morse telegraphy, and by 0.2 for two-way single sideband (SSB) voice.
There is no reduction for FM.
3. Duty cycle caused by on/off time or time averaging. The RF safety
guidelines permit RF exposures to be averaged over certain periods of
time with the average not to exceed the limit for continuous exposure.
The averaging time for occupational/controlled exposure is 6 minutes,
while the averaging time for general population/uncontrolled exposure is 30 minutes. For example, if the relevant time interval for timeaveraging is 6 minutes, an amateur could be exposed to two times the
applicable power density limit for three minutes as long as he or she
were not exposed at all for the preceding or following three minutes.
A routine evaluation is not required for vehicular mobile or handheld transceiver stations. Amateur radio operators should be aware,
however, of the potential for exposure to RF electromagnetic fields
from these stations, and take measures (such as reducing transmitting
power to the minimum necessary, positioning the radiating antenna as
far from humans as practical, and limiting continuous transmitting
time) to protect themselves and the occupants of their vehicles.
Amateur radio operators should also be aware that the new FCC
radio-frequency safety regulations address exposure to people—and
not the strength of the signal. Amateurs may exceed the MPE limits as
long as no one is exposed to the radiation.
How to read the chart: If you are radiating 500 watts from your 10meter dipole (about 3 dB gain), there must be at least 4.5 meters (about
15 feet) between you (and your family) and the antenna—and a distance
of 10 meters (about 33 feet) between the antenna and your neighbors.
