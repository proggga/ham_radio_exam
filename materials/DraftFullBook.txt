Introduction
Who is this manual for?
First of all, congratulations on passing your Intermediate Licence exam! However, when
did you take the exam? If it was before 2019, then you will need to look at my
Intermediate manual, as a lot of the material in the Full Licence speci cation was moved
to the Intermediate to make it harder! Therefore the Full Licence speci cation assumes
you know the new Intermediate speci cation.
If you enjoyed my Foundation Licence and Intermediate Licence manuals, you are going
to love this Full Licence manual. It’s the third manual in my quartet of manuals. The fourth
one is Direct to Full. So why would you want to study for the Full Licence? There are
some challenging concepts, but you will gain a deeper understanding of radio
communications. I know I did! I obtained my Full licence many years ago and I have learnt
a lot by writing this manual.

What does this manual cover?
The Full Licence speci cation gives us the opportunity to have fun investigating
transistors and eld e ect transistors. We use our knowledge of radiation resistance to
delve deeper into the working of antennas. We nd out more about digital radio and a
new kind of modulation called I/Q modulation. This manual covers the same layout as the
Intermediate manual. As we go up the Licence levels, we are getting more serious, with
more power allowed. However learning for the Full Licence will still be fun, with lots of
challenging activities.
I have used the National Physical Laboratory convention for SI Units (https://
www.npl.co.uk/resources/the-si-units) with a space left between the numerical value and
unit symbol, such as 25 kg.

How can I use this manual?
Just like the other two manuals, you can go to websites easily to nd out more
information. You should do the activities, as they will help your understanding, which is
certainly the case with transistors. You cannot remember the di erent classes of ampli er
without investigating them. I have provided open ended questions with answers, which
you should use to test your understanding. They are designed to be on one side of A4,
with the answers on the other side. Anyone can test you, by reading the question, and
seeing if you are correct.

I’m a youngster, do I need an adult to help me?
As with the other manuals, yes, unless you are an adult already! There are lots of
activities, some of which you need to have an adult present. Your instructor should do a
risk assessment and take suitable precautions. If you have an accident, I take no
responsibility!

Who am I?
I am a STEM ambassador, so I do a lot of outreach with youngsters. I want them to enjoy
physics and science, and of course amateur radio, as much as I do. I am keen for girls to
take advantage of the opportunities available to them, in engineering and science.
I have a BSc in Physics from Imperial College, where I stayed to gain my MSc in Applied
Optics. I worked for a while for Marconi as a development engineer, before going into
teaching.
I got my Full Licence in 1992 and I joined the Hilderstone Radio Society G0HRS. We
helped a local school to contact Tim Peake in 2016, which was truly inspiring for all who
attended the event. In 2023 we repeated the exercise with a lucky local primary school. It
was an amazing inspiring event.
My other interests include weight training, jive dancing, sailing and astronomy.

Radio Waves
In the Intermediate manual, we learnt that oscillating electrons send out electromagnetic
waves of energy, with oscillations of the electric and magnetic elds. Also, we met the
concept of phase, and phase di erence.
In this Full manual, we explain what is meant by the power ux density of the wave, and
how to calculate it. Also we consider another kind of polarisation, circular polarisation.
Fourier Transforms are in the Full syllabus but we covered them in the Intermediate
Manual. Likewise we discussed sampling of a wave in the Intermediate Manual and saw
the disastrous consequences if the sampling rate is too slow. Here you need to know
about false signals called aliases and how to calculate them.

Electromagnetic Energy
Thanks to the investigations by Michael Faraday, we have seen that an electric current
can create a magnetic eld, while a changing magnetic eld can create a current.
James Clerk Maxwell discovered that there exists a self-restoring, permanent, travelling
disturbance in electric and magnetic elds. Changing electric elds induce changing
magnetic elds induce changing electric elds induce changing magnetic elds and so
on. He calculated that these disturbances travel at the speed of light.
All through the Foundation and Intermediate manuals, we have had the mantra:
oscillating electrons in wires produce electromagnetic waves in space,
electromagnetic waves in space cause electrons in wires to oscillate.
Well, that’s not strictly true!
Electromagnetic energy propagates in the form of photons. A photon is a bundle or
packet of energy. The energy owing from a source is not continuous but emitted in
packets of energy. We are familiar with light photons but radio too travels in the form of
radio photons. The energy of a photon increases with its frequency, so gamma photons
are the most dangerous and radio photons are the weakest.
https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum2.html
The best example of a radio photon is the emission of radio energy from Jupiter. Radio
astronomers observe the photons of 21 cm wavelength, emitted by hydrogen gas at 1420
MHz, to study the activity of the planet. Another example is in Magnetic Resonance
Imaging, MRI. Researchers at Delft University of Technology have used a
superconducting qubit to listen to the weakest radio signal of all - single radio photons!
(https://www.laserfocusworld.com/detectors-imaging/article/16566810/quantum-circuitdetects-individual-radio-photons)
What is the energy of a radio photon emitted by your handheld radio on 2 metres,
145.500 MHz? Thanks to Max Planck, we can work it out and it comes out to about
1 x 10 to the power of minus 25 joules of energy.
If you are transmitting one watt of power, each second you are sending out 10 septillion
photons, or 10 to the power of positive 25, which is rather a lot. Each photon does not
carry much energy, but if you have enough of them, you de nitely need to consider the
safety aspect.
The wave theory of light could not account for the photoelectric e ect, where electrons
are emitted from a surface when light is shone on it. Einstein explained the phenomenon,

for which he achieved the Nobel Prize for Physics, using Planck’s concept of photons,
whose energy are absorbed by the electrons. However when studying radio, we are
happy to use the wave theory, especially when explaining e ects like refraction,
interference and di raction. We ignore the fact that radio waves are not continuous but
we pretend that they are! Radio is naturally digital and not analogue.

Power Flux Density
This diagram shows a radio wave at an instant in time, with the wavelength as the
distance between two peaks. For example, the wavelength could be 6 m.

Diagram of an electromagnetic wave
If we could measure the electric eld at one particular spot, we would nd the strength of
the eld changes with time in a sinusoidal fashion. If the polarisation is vertical, the
electrical oscillations are up and down. The magnetic eld is in phase with the electric
eld, meaning that they reach maximum strength at the same time, and are both zero at
the same time. E is the vertical electric eld, along the y axis, measured in volts/metre, V/
m. H is the horizontal magnetic eld, along the x axis, measured in A/m. They are not only
at right angles to each other, but also at right angles to the direction of travel, z. The
energy ux, the ow of energy of the electromagnetic wave is in the z direction.
When we multiply the two elds, we obtain the power ux density of the wave, measured
in W/m2, the power per unit area, which is the power falling on one square metre.

Power ux density = E x H
For example, a 3 GHz wave is incident on a surface. What is the power ux density if E is
100 V/m and H is 265 mA/m?
power ux density = 100 x 0.265 = 26.5 W/m2

Impedance of free space
This topic is outside the speci cation but it is interesting nevertheless. If we divide E in V/
m by H in A/m we get the units V/A, which is Ω. In fact it is the impedance of free space,
equal to 377Ω. Check it with the example above - 100 V/m divided by 265 mA/m. Just as
oscillating signals experience impedance when travelling through a coaxial cable, so do
oscillating electromagnetic waves travelling through the vacuum of space. At one time it
was thought that the waves needed a medium to travel through, which they called the
ether.
Also interesting is the impedance of free space is given by two quantities that are related
to the speed of the radio waves - the permeability of free space μ0 and the permittivity of
free space ε0. The permeability of free space governs the magnetic eld and inductance of
a solenoid, and the permittivity of free space governs the electric eld between the two
plates of an air capacitor and its capacitance.
The impedance of free space = √( μ0/ε0 ) = 377 Ω
The speed of radio waves = 1/ √ (μ0ε0)
So the ratio of the quantities governs the impedance of electromagnetic waves travelling
through space and their product governs the speed at which they do so.

Linear Polarisation

If we are standing along the z axis, we would see the wave travelling towards us or away
from us. The electric eld would be oscillating up and down. If the frequency of the wave
is 1.0 Hz, we would see the electric eld strength oscillate up and down, once every
second. Starting with a maximum value in the up direction, it would decrease to zero after
quarter of a second, change direction, again reaching a maximum value pointing

downwards after half a second, before returning to zero, as shown in the diagram:
If the frequency of the wave is 50 MHz, it would be a blur! We would see a vertical line, as
shown in the diagram. We say the wave is linearly plane polarised, because we just see a
line, in one direction. The plane of oscillation is vertical. The oscillations are in one
direction only.

A horizontal dipole antenna transmits horizontally polarised waves. However after
interaction with the ionosphere, an HF wave will return to earth in a di erent plane. This is
not an issue, as there will be a component of the electric eld in a horizontal direction for
our horizontal receiving antenna.
For UHF and VHF, this is an issue. Your handheld’s vertical antenna will transmit vertically
plane polarised radio waves. Your friend’s receiving antenna should also be vertical. Try
changing the orientation and observe the di erence in signal strength.
Activity 1.1 Investigation of polarisation of radio waves using a grid.
Activity 1.2 investigating polaroid lters

Circular Polarisation
If we see the electric eld rotating in a circular fashion, then we have a circularly polarised
wave. The diagram shows the electric eld at one eighth of its way in the cycle. It is
rotating clockwise as it is approaching us, so it is a left-circularly polarised wave. If it is
going away from us it will rotate in an anti-clockwise direction, but it is still a left-circularly

polarised wave. Wiki has a great animation showing the rotating electric eld. https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization
How is this possible? Where is the oscillation? The electric eld can have oscillating
components in both the y axis and the x axis. The y component is a maximum when the x

component is zero. A quarter of a cycle later, the y component is now zero and the x
component is a maximum. They are 90 degrees out of phase. At t = 1/8 of the cycle, the
resultant is at 45 degrees because the two components are equal. All the time the two
components are oscillating up and down, side to side, while the resultant electric eld
goes round in a circle. This is the circularly polarised wave.
In the diagram, the wave is coming towards us and the electric eld is rotating in a clockwise

direction. According to the IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, we
say this is left-circular polarisation. If we were to turn round and look at the wave going
away from us, the electric eld would rotate in an anti-clockwise direction, but it is still
left-circularly polarised.
If we are back at the z = 0 position, with the wave travelling away from us, and we see the
electric eld rotating clockwise, then the wave is right-circularly polarised. What would we
see if we turned round and the wave was coming towards us?
What if the electric eld components are not equal, if Ex does not equal Ey? In that case
we get an elliptically polarised wave. This is not in the speci cation, I just thought I would
mention it!
A slinky is basically a helix, similar to a corkscrew or a spiral staircase, and we can make
an antenna out of it. We use an axial mode helical antenna, which comes in left and right
handed versions. A right handed helical antenna radiates and receives right-circular
polarisation. It will not receive left-circularly polarised waves. Vicedeal o er an RF Helical
antenna for less than £21.

A good practical to show what is happening with x and y components is Lissajou’s gures
on an oscilloscope, where a circular trace can be produced.
Activity 1.3 Lissajou’s gures on an oscilloscope
Confused between your left and right hand, clockwise and anti-clockwise? Then spare a
thought for the IEEE! They decreed the rule above, wanting it to agree with the optical
de nition of circular polarisation. Unfortunately they got it the wrong way round, so now
we have two opposite de nitions!

Helical Antennas
Helical antennas are used where we cannot be sure of the orientation of the antenna and
hence the polarisation, such as for communicating with spacecraft, satellites and tracking
animals. However the handedness of the receiving antenna must be the same as the
transmitting antenna. A left-polarised antenna must be used for both transmitting and
receiving. If you used a right-hand polarised antenna, the received signal would be weak.
Helical antennas are found on the Moon and Mars. The Insight lander took a sel e at the
end of its mission!

Sampling
Sampling was covered comprehensively in the Intermediate manual, page 22.
According to the Nyquist theorem, a signal is perfectly represented when we sample at a
frequency at least twice the maximum signal frequency.

Sampling frequency > 2 x Maximum signal frequency
In theory, if we sample at a higher rate, there will be no improvement.
What if there are frequencies present which are higher than half of the sampling
frequency. For example, if the signal frequency is 2 kHz we must sample more than 4
kHz. In the Intermediate manual, we gave the example of a sampling frequency of 5 Hz,
so the signal should not have been higher than 2.5 Hz. Unfortunately, a 6 Hz signal was
present! The consequence was a spurious 1 Hz result.
For the Full Licence, you need to understand that this false image is called an alias and
this phenomenon is called aliasing. You also need to be able to calculate it.
There is a nice animation on this wiki page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing
Activity 1.4 investigating aliasing using GNU Radio
You can demonstrate the e ect of changing the sample rate using GNU Radio, by
showing the graphs in the time and frequency domains.
This website has a brilliant applet which shows where the alias frequency is:
http://webapps.chem.uoa.gr/efs/applets/AppletNyquist/Appl_Nyquist2.html
The frequency spectrum in the applet shows the signal frequency, the sampling frequency
and Nyquist frequency, which is half the sampling frequency. For example, change the
signal frequency to 10.0 Hz. Now change the sampling frequency to 20.0 Hz. What has
happened? It has sampled at all the zero points! So no sample is produced.
It is like a stroboscopic e ect. When you see the spokes of a wheel on a lm, they seem
to be stationary, if the shutter rate on the camera matches the rotation of the spokes. The
sampling of an analog to digital converter ADC works in the same way, taking samples of
a changing electrical signal.

Change the sampling frequency to 29.0 Hz
Everything is ne and we have our sampled frequency at 10 Hz.
Any sampling frequency greater than twice the signal frequency will give us a sample.

However, now change the sampling frequency to 16 Hz, keeping the signal at 10 Hz.
There is an alias at 6.0 Hz. The sampling frequency is too low.

fi

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

18
Try a signal more than half the sampling frequency. For example, change the sampling
frequency back to 20.0 Hz but make the signal 12.0 Hz. We have an alias at 8.0 Hz,

because the signal frequency is too high. The alias frequency is 2.0 Hz below the Nyquist
frequency, because the signal is 2.0 Hz above the Nyquist frequency.
What happens if the sampling frequency is so low that it is less than the signal frequency?
Try signal frequency = 20.0 Hz, sampling frequency = 14.0 Hz.
There is an alias at 6.0 Hz. The symmetry of the previous examples appears to have gone.

Where is the alias frequency?
The wiki page, the applet and GNU Radio can give you a good idea of how aliases are
produced. To calculate the alias frequency, it is quite simple.
fo = signal frequency
fs = sampling frequency
N = Nyquist frequency = 1/2 of the sampling frequency = fs/2
fA = alias frequency

fA = N - (fo - N) = 2N - fo = fs - fo
Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

19
For example, the sampling frequency = 10 kHz. The signal frequency fo= 5.1 kHz
N = 5.0 kHz
fA = 5.0 - (5.1 - 5.0) = 5.0 - 0.1 = 4.9 kHz
or
fA = fs - fo = 10.0 - 5.1 = 4.9 kHz
There will be an alias frequency at 4.9 kHz. From a symmetry point of view, the signal
frequency is 0.1 Hz above the Nyquist frequency, so the alias is 0.1 Hz below the Nyquist
frequency.
Where does the formula come from? The simple answer is symmetry. The alias frequency
is as much below N as the signal frequency is above. If there was a di erence of 200 Hz
above, then the alias would be 200 Hz below. We saw that graphically on the frequency
spectrum.
Where does the formula come from, really? The explanation is beyond the speci cation. If
you want to know, go to this web page. You need to copy and paste it. http://
www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE2_EE/Lecture 5 - Sampling (notes).pdf
What happens if the sampling frequency is less than the signal frequency?
We tried signal frequency = 20.0 Hz, sampling frequency = 14.0 Hz.
There was an alias at 6.0 Hz. Does the formula still work? The symmetry appears to be
broken.
fA = 2N - fo = 14.0 - 20.0 = -6.0 Hz.
We get a negative answer, so we must take the magnitude, which is 6.0 Hz.
Try another one. fo = 10.0 Hz, fs = 8.0 Hz.
fA = 8.0 - 10.0 = - 2.0 Hz.
So the alias is at 2.0 Hz, which we can see nicely on the frequency spectrum.

Anti-alias frequency lters
What is the highest frequency present in your signal? If you think you will experience alias
frequencies distorting your signal, you need to know the range of frequencies in your
signal. For telephony, ordinary voice signals will be limited to 3 kHz, so you would sample
at higher than 6 kHz, ideally 2.5 to 3 times higher. You would use a low pass lter to make
sure that there are no frequencies higher than 3 kHz in your signal. Such a lter is called
an anti-alias lter, used to eliminate or suppress any aliases.
If there are frequencies in your signal higher than the Nyquist frequency, half the sampling
rate, then they will not be sampled and they will create alias frequencies, distorting your
sampled signal. Once you know your upper limit of frequency, you can design an
appropriate lter.

Radio Waves Answers
1. An electromagnetic wave is travelling towards you. It is a right handed circularly
polarised wave. This means that the electric eld is rotating in an anti-clockwise
directions.
2. We obtain the power density of an electromagnetic wave by multiplying the electric
eld strength in V/m by the magnetic eld strength is A/m.
3. An electromagnetic wave has a power density of 100 W/m2. If the electric eld strength
Is 5 V/m, the magnetic eld strength is 100/5, which is 20 A/m.
4. The phase relationship between the electric and magnetic elds of an electromagnetic
wave is that they are in phase, both reaching a maximum at the same time.
5. An audio signal contains frequencies up to 3 kHz. Therefore the recommended Nyquist
rate for sampling is twice that, 6 Hz.
6. If you sample at a lower frequency than the Nyquist rate, you are liable to get false
images or aliases.
7. If you sample at 5 kHz, the time interval between samples is 1/5 ms or 0.2 ms.
8. The audio signal at 1100 Hz should be sampled at a frequency of at least 2200 Hz to
be faithfully reproduced. This converts to a sampling period of 1/2.2 ms, 0.45 ms.
Therefore 0.5 ms is not often enough.
9. The alias frequency is given by fs - fo. The sampling frequency is 1/0.5 ms, which is 2.0
kHz. The signal frequency is 1.1 kHz. Therefore the alias frequency = 2.0 - 1.1 = 0.9 kHz.
10. For a signal at 25 Hz, the sampling frequency should be greater than 50 Hz. Therefore
there must be an alias frequency, given by fs - fo, which is 50 - 25 = 15 Hz.
11. The Nyquist frequency is 20 Hz. The signal is 5 Hz above the Nyquist frequency so
the alias frequency is 5 Hz below, which is therefore 15 Hz. The frequency diagram looks
like this:

Activity 1.1 Investigation of polarisation of radio waves using a grid.
You need to make a grid from pieces of wires, in a frame, about 2 cm apart.
You also need two handheld radios.
Have the radio antennas vertical on both radios, placed a metre apart.
Hold the frame with the wires vertical in front of the transmitting radio and note if a signal
reaches the receiving radio.
Now hold the frame with the wires horizontal.
The radio waves from the transmitter are vertically polarised. The vertical wires absorb the
energy of the radio wave and a weaker signal is received. Turning the frame allows the
waves to pass. This investigation shows that the radio waves are polarised. The vertical
waves do not go through the gaps of the wire frame, they are stopped by the wires.
Activity 1.2 investigating polaroid lters
You can carry out a similar investigation to activity 1.1 using light. You need two polarising
lters and source of light, such as a torch. The light from the torch is unpolarised. One
lter will allow polarised light through, in one particular plane.
We can see the laser light on the screen, passing through two polaroid lters.

Activity 1.3 Lissajou’s gures on an oscilloscope
You need two signal generators and an oscilloscope.

Inside the oscilloscope there are horizontal and vertical plates. The normal input is to the
horizontal plates to make the wave display up and down, in the y direction. There is
another input to the vertical plates to make the signal oscillate in the horizontal x
direction. Applying signals of exactly the same frequency to the two inputs will produce
cool traces, such as a line at an angle, or a circle. With signals of multiple frequencies,
you can replicate the Meta trademark!

Activity 1.4 investigating aliasing using GNU Radio
The GNU website is very helpful in explaining how to instal GNU Radio. (https://
www.gnuradio.org/)
The aim of this investigation is to show how inadequate sampling will produce alias
frequencies. This tutorial is helpful too (https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/

Start with a low frequency of 1 kHz and keep the sampling rate at 32 kHz throughout.
The program looks like this:

Now change the signal frequency to 15 kHz. It doesn’t look like a sine wave to me!

And now for a signal at 18 kHz, sampling at 32 kHz, we get an alias at (32 - 18) = 14 kHz.

DC Circuits
At Intermediate level you met the formulae for series and parallel resistors, Ohm’s law and
power. You calculated the charge on a capacitor. You understood the term ‘self-inductance’
and how a back EMF is produced. In the activity to investigate the formulae for capacitors
you included a resistor to measure the charging time. Here, that charging time is called the
time constant.
At Full Licence level the circuit calculations will be harder, with a mixture of series and
parallel resistors. The factors affecting the capacitance of a capacitor are explained,
including the different insulators or dielectrics. At intermediate level, we learnt the formula
for capacitors in series and parallel. At Full Licence level, we calculate the actual charge
on the capacitor plates. Capacitors and Inductors are key components of radio circuits, so
they are the focus of this chapter.

Tolerances
On eBay, resistors are sold with tolerances of 1% or 5%. For a potential divider, with a 6v
battery, and an output voltage of 4v required, we would use say a 1k resistor in series with
a 2k resistor. What range of voltages would we have for a tolerance of 5%?
Taking a higher limit, with R1 to be 105% of 2k or 2100 Ω, and a lower tolerance for R2 to
be 950 Ω
Vout = Vin x R1/(R1+R2)
= 6 x 2100/(2100+950) = 4.13 v
Going the other way, with R1 as 1900 Ω, and R2 as 1050 Ω
Vout = 6 x 1900/(1900+1050) = 3.86 v
With both of the resistors high, we have
Vout = 6 X 2100/(2100+1050) = 4.0 v
What do we get if both are low?
The correct way to nd the uncertainty in a calculation is to add the errors for the addition
R1+R2, which is (2000 +/-100) plus (1000+/-50), which gives 3000 +/- 150 Ω. The
percentage uncertainty is therefore (150/3000) x 100% or 5%.
When we do the division of R1/(R1+R2) we add the percentage uncertainties of top and
bottom. This gives a total uncertainty of 10%. So the output voltage = 4 +/- 0.4 volts.
Don’t forget there is uncertainty in the uncertainty!

Current
Current is the ow of electrical charge. In copper wires those charges are electrons, in the
electrolytes of batteries they are ions.
Charge Q is de ned by the product of current x time, and is measured in coulombs, C.

Q=Ixt

fi

fi

fl

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

If a current of 2mA ows for an hour, how much charge has passed?
Q = 0.002 x 3600 = 7.2 C
Each electron has a very small amount of charge, so 7.2 coulombs represents a lot of
electrons! In fact, it is about 4.5 x 1019, which is 45,000,000,000,000,000,000. About!
Current itself is de ned in terms of the magnetic force between two wires when current
passes through them.

Potential difference
The de nition of potential difference is not required in the speci cation. Nevertheless it is
important to understand what it means and the de nition can help us. Potential difference
V is de ned as the energy W in joules which are transferred by each coulomb of charge Q
owing.

V = W/Q
For example, let’s say we had one coulomb of charge owing through a resistor each
second, and a potential difference of 6 volts across the resistor. This would mean that
each coulomb will transfer 6 joules of heat energy to the resistor.
A 12 volt battery will transfer 12 joules of chemical energy to electrical energy to each
coulomb of charge passing.

Power
Power is de ned as the energy transferred every second.

P = W/t
A 1000 W electrical heater transfers a 1000 J of electrical energy to heat every second.
To nd the power, current or voltage in a resistor we use the formula we learnt at
Intermediate.
W = V x Q from the de nition of Potential Difference.
So Power P = V x Q/t = V x I
In the example above, the heater works on a mains voltage of 230 v. Therefore the current
I is given by
I = P/V = 1000/230 = 4.3 A
These are rms values of course. From the de nition of root mean square, we know that a
DC current of 4.3 A would produce the same power.
We can use Ω’s law, V = IR, to produce two new formulae for power in terms of resistance.
P = I x I x R or P = V x V /R

Resistance
Resistance is de ned as the ratio of the potential difference to the current.
R = V/I
Ohm’s law states that the resistance is constant, provided the temperature is constant.
If the resistance is constant, the potential difference is proportional to the current.
For the electrical heater, its resistance is given by
R = V/I = 230/4.3 = 53 Ω.
Alternatively,
So R = V x V/P = 230 x 230/1000 = 53 Ω

Ohm’s law
At Full licence level, the circuits could be a mix of series and parallel resistors. We
calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors and add it to the series resistor.
For example, we have two parallel 100 Ω resistors in series with another 100 Ω
resistor.
Two identical resistors in parallel can be replaced by one which is a half of the values. In
this case they can be replaced with a 50 Ω resistor. The total resistance is therefore 150
Ω. How much current ows through each resistor and what is the potential difference
across them?
A more dif cult example would be three different resistors in parallel. We need to use the
reciprocal formula. For example, we have three resistors in parallel, 20, 40 and 60 Ω.
1/R = 1/20 + 1/40 + 1/60.
The common denominator is 120
1/R = 6/120 + 3/120 + 2/120
1/R = 11/120
R = 120/11
R = 11 Ω
All three resistors can be replaced by one resistor equal to 11 Ω. Note that the equivalent
resistor is less than the lowest value 20 Ω. Adding the 40 and 60 Ω resistors in parallel to
the 20 Ω resistor decreases the resistance in the circuit because we now have more
pathways for the current.
Activity 2.1 an investigation into parallel resistors

Source Resistance
Source resistance is mentioned in the Measurements chapter. We can use Ohm’s law and
the power formula to understand the concept.
Wouldn’t it be great if we had a voltage source that provided a constant voltage, whatever
the load. No such source exists! They have an internal resistance, r, causing energy to be
lost in the source. In the intermediate manual, page 33, ‘cells and electromotive force’, we
measured the voltage of a cell on its own and then with a load of 100 Ω. The voltage
dropped from 1.5 v to 1.4 v. We can use Ohm’s law to nd that source resistance. The
source resistance is represented by a resistor symbol next to the cell.

fl

fi

32
A more realistic drop in voltage would be from 1.5 to 1.4925 v.
The lost volts = 1.5 - 1.4925 = 0.0075 v.
The current in the circuit is V/R = 1.4925/100 = 14.925 mA.
The same current passes through the cell.
Therefore the internal resistance, r = ‘the lost volts’/I = 0.10075/0.014 = 0.5 Ω
A typical 1.5 v cell has an internal resistance of about 0.5 Ω.
We can now work out what the terminal voltage will be for different loads. As the load
increases, the current decreases. Therefore we can plot a graph of the terminal voltage for
increasing current.
Assuming the internal resistance is constant, what is the current and terminal voltage for
loads of a) 10 Ω and b) 1000 Ω?
a) the total resistance in the circuit is 10.5 Ω. Therefore the current is 1.5/10.5 = 0.143 A
The lost volts in the cell will be I x r = 0.143 x 0.5 = 0.07 v
The terminal voltage will be 1.5 - 0.07 v = 1.43 v
b) the total resistance is now 1000.5 Ω. Therefore the current is 1.5/1000.5 = 0.001499 A.
The lost volts in the cell will be I x r = 0.001499 x 0.5 = 0.00075 v
The terminal voltage will be 1.5 - 0.00075 = 1.49925 v
We can now plot the graph of terminal voltage against current.

Activity 2.2 Measure the Internal resistance of a cell.

Maximum Power Transfer
Optional! This is not in the speci cation but it is a good application of the power formula.
We can see that the output voltage decreases as the load draws more current. It is only
when no current is drawn that we have the full voltage of the cell. We may not be able to
have a constant source of voltage, but is there an optimum current for which we get the
most ef cient output, the maximum power transfer?
If we draw less current, the output voltage is high. If we draw more current, the output
voltage is lower. Is there a balance point?
Yes! When the load resistance is equal to the source resistance. This concept is similar to
impedance matching, when we make the impedance of the transmission line equal to the
impedance of the antenna.
In the example above, the maximum power will be when the source resistance r of 0.5 Ω is
is equal to a load resistance R of 0.5 Ω.
The total resistance in the circuit is 1.0 Ω. The current will be V/R = 1.5/1 = 1.5 A.
The power in the resistor is I x I x R = 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 = 1.125 W
Is this the maximum power?
If R = 1 Ω, then the current will be V/R = 1.5/1.5 = 1 A
The power in the resistor = I x I x R = 1 x 1 x 1 = 1 W
If we plot the power in the resistor as a function of the current we get this graph:

Capacitors
If we double the voltage of a battery charging a capacitor, twice the charge will ow on to
the plates. What doesn’t change is the capacitance of the capacitor. Therefore the
capacitance of a capacitor is de ned as the ratio of the potential difference across its
plates to the charge on them and is measured in Farads.

C = Q/V
For example, a capacitor holds a charge of 3 μC with a potential difference of 6v.
Therefore its capacitance is given by
C = 3 μ/6 = 0.5 μF
Notice we didn’t change the micro to 10-6 or one millionth. We just had to remember the
micro at the end of the calculation.
If we know the capacitance of the capacitor we can calculate the charge on its plates. The
formula becomes
Q=CxV
For example, a 100 μF capacitor has a potential difference of 2 volts. Therefore,
Q = C x V = 100 μ x 2 = 200 μC
A capacitor not only stores electric charge, it also stores electric energy. We can replace a
battery with a charged capacitor.
This demo shows how a charged capacitor can light an LED. The activity also investigates
the energy stored and shows that if we treble the voltage, the energy stored is nine times

www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/How-to-use-a-charged-capacitor-to-light-anled
Activity 2.3 use a capacitor to light an LED and nd out what factors affect the energy
stored.
Where does this energy come from? Ultimately from the chemical energy of the battery.
However, work must be done to get the electrons on the plate of the capacitor. They carry
a negative charge and repel each other. Work is done against that electric force. With
more push from the battery, by doubling the voltage, twice as many electrons can be
stored on the plate. This leads to four times as much energy. The capacitor gives up that
electrical energy when it is discharged.

Factors affecting capacitance
Area
With a larger area of plate more charge can be stored. The capacitance is proportional to
the area, which means if we double the area, we double the capacitance of the capacitor.
This is used in a variable air capacitor, where one plate is xed and the other plate can be
turned. Therefore the area of overlap of the two plates will change, changing the
capacitance.
The plates are made from thin metal lm or plastic with a metal coating. The lm is rolled
to reduce space.
Distance between the plate

Doubling the distance between the plates halves the capacitance. This is because the
electric force of the negative plate is weaker as it is further from the positive plate. If we
want a high value of capacitance, the distance needs to be made very small. This is
possible in electrolytic capacitors where the plates are very close together.
The dielectric
The dielectric is the insulating layer between the metal plates. It affects the strength of the
electric eld between the plates. It becomes polarised by the electric eld, meaning that
one end becomes positive and the other negative. It can be solid or a paste, even a liquid,
gel, air or a vacuum.
Ceramic
Ceramic capacitors are usually used as a bypass capacitor and for high frequency
applications.
Mica
Mica capacitors have low value capacitance, are stable and reliable, and are used at high
frequencies.
Electrolytic
The electrolyte is usually paper soaked in an electrolyte. The capacitor is made from a thin
lm of aluminium. The dielectric is a layer of aluminium oxide formed when a voltage is
applied. They can have large values of capacitance.
Plastic
Polyester lm has a high dielectric constant, resulting in high values of capacitance. They
are found in DC applications such as coupling and decoupling. Polycarbonate capacitors
are very stable and are used in circuits with a xed frequency.
Putting all the factors together, the formula for the capacitance of a capacitor in terms of
the area of one of its plates A, the distance between the plates d, and the permittivity k is
given by

C = kA/d
A has the units m, distance in m and k in F/m. This is the formula given in the speci cation,
but I prefer the symbol ε for permittivity. Therefore the formula becomes

C = εA/d
We have met the permittivity of free space εo before. The permittivity of the dielectric is
related to εo by the relative permittivity of the dielectric, εr which is just a number. For
example, the relative permittivity of mica is 5.

ε = εo x ε r
What can go wrong?
Apart from putting a polarised capacitor in the wrong way, what else can go wrong?
Exceeding the DC working voltage! If the voltage is too high there is the risk that the
dielectric breaks down. A short circuit could follow with a spark.
Dielectric loss is another problem, where the alternating electric eld is too fast for the
dielectric at high frequencies. The dielectric cannot switch fast enough and energy is lost
as heat.
This next activity shows you the construction of a capacitor and how to make one of your
own.

Activity 2.4 Take a capacitor apart. Make a capacitor.

Charging a capacitor
In activity 6 of the Intermediate DC, in order to show the capacitor formula, we charged a
capacitor and timed how long it took to reach 1 volt. A measure of the time to charge a
capacitor and resistor in series is given by the time constant , pronounced tau, which is

the product of their values.

time constant

= resistance x capacitance
= CR

The time constant only gives a rough idea of the charging time, as we can see from the
graph of voltage against time.
Vs is the voltage of the supply and V is the voltage across the capacitor.
‘A measure of the time to charge’ is too vague! The time constant is the time taken to
reach 63% of the nal value Vs. The growth of the voltage on the capacitor is exponential.
The second graph shows that the current is initially high and gradually decreases to zero.
The third graph shows the charge on the capacitor starts at zero and increases
exponentially to its nal value Q.

37
CR is a useful quantity in circuits where timing is important, such as multivibrators where
LEDs ash on and off. For example a 1 kΩ resistor in series with a 100 μF capacitor has a
time constant
t = 1000 Ω x (100/1000000) F = 0.1 seconds.
If you want to slow things down to give 10 seconds, then R must be 100 kΩ.
To fully charge the capacitor, it takes about 5 time constants.
If R = 0, it takes no time at all, meaning that the capacitor will charge immediately.
Activity 2.5 Charging a Capacitor to measure the time constant

Coupling
A capacitor blocks direct current, DC. Or does it? What will happen in the circuit of activity
2.6 when you press the switch?
Activity 2.6 can a current ow through a capacitor?
A capacitor blocks a steady DC voltage. If there is a change in the voltage, the capacitor
will pass the current. When you press the switch the LED lights momentarily, so current
must have passed. Eventually the capacitor is charged and it blocks the current ow.
The situation is similar to a potential divider where the potential difference across the
larger resistor increases as its resistance increases, as in the case of the lower resistor in
the diagram. All the potential difference is across the capacitor because it is blocking the
DC.

Inductors

Inductance is measured in Henries, named after the American scientist Joseph Henry. An
inductor has an inductance of one henry if it induces an emf of 1 volt when the current is
changing at 1 amp per second.
When we pass current through an inductor in series with a resistor it takes time for the
current to reach a steady value. The graph shows this:
You can see the time delay in this activity, which I recommend you do, as it will help with
your understanding of inductance.
Activity 2.7 inductor delay
The formula for the time constant is

= inductance/resistance = L/R
For example, a 1 mH inductor is in series with a 1k resistor.
The time constant = 1 mH/ 1 kΩ = 1 μs.
Activity 2.8 Measure the time constant for an inductor using an oscilloscope

39
When a steady current ows through a coil or an inductor, it stores magnetic energy.
Where does that energy come from? As with the capacitor, it comes ultimately from the
chemical energy of the battery. The current from the battery starts from zero and builds up.
It is this changing current that induces an electromotive force or voltage that opposes the
battery voltage. Work is done by the current in overcoming this opposition, and the work
done becomes the stored magnetic energy in the coil. The coil releases that energy when
the battery is switched off. Because this can happen very quickly, it can seem to be a lot of
energy.
Therefore we have the mantra:

an inductor is to a magnetic eld
as
a capacitor is to an electric eld

Activities
Activity 2.1 an investigation into parallel resistors
You need a low value resistor, such as 10 Ω, a variable resistor and a multimeter to
measure ohms.
How does the output resistance of this circuit depend on R? Predict what will happen as
you increase R. Measure the output resistance with an ohm-meter.

Activity 2.2 Measure the Internal resistance of a cell.
You need a single 1.5 v cell, a multimeter and a 10 Ω or low value resistor.

40
With the multimeter set to DC volts, measure the voltage across the terminals of the cell.
This gives the EMF or electromotive force of the cell.
Now place the 10 Ω quickly across the cell and note the voltage V. Remove the resistor
quickly, so as not to drain the battery.
EMF = V + lost volts in the cell
The lost volts = EMF - V.
We need to know the current in the circuit so change the multimeter to measure DC
current and place it in the circuit in series with the 10 Ω resistor, again as quickly as
possible.
The lost volts = the current x the internal resistance = I x r
Therefore we can calculate r.
I measured 3.04 v for two cells in series on open circuit.
With a resistor it dropped to 2.94 v.
Therefore the lost volts = 0.1 v
The current = 0.08 A.
Therefore r = lost volts/current = 0.1/0.08 = 1.25 Ω, for two cells.

Activity 2.3 use a capacitor to light an LED and nd out what factors affect the energy
stored.

Try changing the voltage and the value of the capacitance.

5 seconds. Plot a graph of voltage against time. Calculate 0.63 of the battery voltage and
mark it on the graph. Read o the time axis for the time constant.
The discharge of the capacitor is exponential as well. The charge or voltage will drop to
37% of the initial value in RC seconds. You can demonstrate this by removing the battery
and measuring the voltage when you press and hold the switch. The discharge current
decreases, as does the charge and voltage.

Activity 2.6 can a current ow through a capacitor?
You need a 1000 μF capacitor, a 10 kΩ resistor, a low value resistor such as 32 Ω, an LED,
a push button switch and a battery pack.
Make sure the capacitor is discharged by shorting it before you begin. Press the switch
and notice the ash of light from the LED. Clearly a current has momentarily passed.

The voltmeter shows the voltage across the resistor gradually decreasing as the capacitor
charges to the full voltage of the battery.

Activity 2.7 inductor delay
You need an inductor, such as a transformer coil, two LEDs, one red, one blue, a low
value resistor such as 32 Ω, a push button switch, connecting leads and battery pack.
The circuit has the inductor parallel to the LEDs, with one blue LED A forward biased and
the red LED B reverse biased.
What do you think will happen when you switch on? When you switch o ?
When you switch on, the blue LED A ashes and stays o . When you switch o , the

reverse biased red LED B ashes momentarily.
Why?
When you rst switch on, the current is changing rapidly. Therefore there is an induced
emf opposing the changing current. However in that short time, the current can pass
through the blue LED. Eventually the current is steady so there is no back emf. The
current by-passes the LED, taking the easier route through the windings of the
transformer.
When you switch o , the current drops rapidly to zero. Again there is an induced emf,
opposing the decreasing current. All that magnetic energy stored in the inductor is
released in the red LED.
The inductor passes the steady DC current but opposes the changing current.
The situation is similar but opposite to the capacitor in activity 2.5. There, the capacitor
allows a changing DC current to initially pass but eventually stops it when it is steady. For
the inductor, it opposes an initial changing DC current but eventually allows it to pass
when it is steady.

Activity 2.6 Measure the time constant for an inductor using an oscilloscope
Connect the inductor in series with a low value resistor and a battery pack.
I used the transformer for the inductor.
Connect the oscilloscope across the resistor.
Experiment with the time base to capture the voltage rise when you switch the battery on.
I found the 2 ms/div setting just right.

The maximum voltage was two divisions, or 1 volt, so I read off the time taken to reach
about 0.6 volt.
The time base was set to 2 ms/div so two divisions equals 4 ms.
The resistance of the transformer coil was 63 Ω and the resistor was 32 Ω.
Time constant = 4 ms.
R = 32 + 63 = 95 Ω
L /R = 4 ms
L = 4 x 95 mH = 380 mH = 0.38 H
I also noticed on the oscilloscope trace the large voltage induced in the opposite negative
direction when the battery was switched off.

1. The charge passing through a resistor in an hour if the current is 2 mA = current x time
= 2 milli x 3600 = 7.2 C.
2. if 120 C of charge passes in 2 minutes, the current = 120/120 = 1 A.
3. The Potential Di erence across a resistor is 5 volts and a charge of 10 C pass through
it. The energy dissipated = V x Q = 5 x 10 = 50 J.
4. A Voltage of 12 volts is applied to a potential divider consisting of two resistors, 1 kΩ
and 2 kΩ in series. The voltage output from the 2k resistor = (2/(1 + 2)) x V = 2/3 x 12
= 8 v.
5. The lost volts = 1.5 - 1.4 = 0.1 v. The current in the circuit = 1.4 v/ 10 Ω = 0.14 A.
Therefore the internal resistance = 0.1/0.14 = 0.7 Ω.
A cell has an EMF of 1.5 volts. When a 10 Ω resistor is placed across the cell the voltage
drops to 1.4 volts. The current in the resistor = the current in the cell = 1.4/10 = 0.14 A.
The lost volts = 1.5 - 1.4 = 0.1 v. Therefore the internal resistance = 0.1/0.14 = 0.7 Ω.
6. Two resistors are in parallel, 6 kΩ and 4 kΩ. The combined resistance = product/sum =
(6 x 4)/(6 + 4) = 2. 4kΩ
7. A 1 μF capacitor is charged to 3 volts. The charge on the plates = C x V = 1 x 3 = 3 μC
8. 12 volts are applied to a 50 Ω resistor. The power dissipated as heat = (V x V)/R =
(12 x 12)/50 = 2.88 W
9. The di erence between potential di erence and electromotive force (emf) is that
potential di erence is the voltage across a component while emf is the potential
di erence across a cell or battery when no current is drawn.
10. There is a voltage drop across a battery when current is drawn because energy is lost
in the battery due to its internal resistance.
11. Ten 100 kΩ resistors are placed in parallel. The combined resistance = 100 k/10 =
10 kΩ.
12. A 50 Ω dummy load is being constructed. This be achieved with some high wattage 1
kΩ resistors by placing 20 of them in parallel.
13. Three identical 100 Ω resistors are in a circuit and give a combined resistance of 150
Ω. The resistors are connected with two in parallel with the remaining one in series.
14. If a capacitor is placed across a battery, it will become charged, and no further current
will ow.
15. The capacitance of a capacitor is proportional to the area of the plates and inversely
proportional to their separation. The permittivity of the dielectric also a ects the
capacitance. The greater the permittivity, the greater the capacitance.
16. The breakdown voltage of a capacitor is the maximum voltage can be applied to a
capacitor before it allows current to pass. Arcing can occur!
17. Four examples of dielectrics used in capacitors are mica, air, polyester and ceramic.
18. The time constant of a RC circuit is a useful measure of the time taken to charge a
capacitor. It is actually about 2/3 of its nal voltage. To e ectively fully charge it will take
about 5 time constants.

19. If a 1μF capacitor is connected to a 1 MΩ resistor, the time constant is 1 second, as
the M cancels with the μ.
20. A time constant of 10 seconds is required in a circuit which has a 10 kΩ resistor. The
capacitance would you need for a capacitor would be 10/10k = 1 mF, as 1/k = milli.
21. High value capacitors can store a dangerous amount of charge. How is a leakage
path provided?
22. Two 100 μF capacitors are placed in series. The combined capacitance is half as they
are identical, so it would be 50 μF.
23. They are now placed in parallel. The combined capacitance is 200 μF.
24. The self-inductance of an inductor is a measure of how much emf will be induced
when the current changes through it. As the current changes a changing magnetic eld is
induced. The eld lines cut through the windings of the inductor to produce an emf which
opposes the current causing it.

28. Two 1 mH inductors are placed in series. The combined inductance is doubled to 2
mH.
29. A 1k Ω resistor has a 5% tolerance. Therefore its lowest value could be 950 Ω and the
highest 1050 Ω. If two of them are placed in series the lowest value could be 1900 Ω and
highest possible values 2100 Ω.
30. If they are placed in parallel the lowest could be 950/2 or 475 Ω and the highest value
1050/2 or 525 Ω.
31. The power produced in series would be P = I x I x R for each resistor. If they are now
placed in parallel the current through each would be twice as much. Therefore there
would be 4 times as much power in parallel than series.
32. No, the power in the resistor would be 12 x 12 / 50 which is 2.9 W.
33. a) The current is 12/50 which is 0.24 A or 240 mA. b) the charge = 240 mA x 1 minute
= 0.24 x 60 seconds = 14.4 C
34. The magnetic material used for the core of the inductor a ects its e ciency and
power handling capability.
35. The time constant = L/R = 5/10 = 0.5 s.
36. When the power is switched o , the magnetic eld collapses and cuts through the
windings of the inductor. An emf is induced to oppose the change which can be very high
as the change in current is rapid.
37. We have 1 kΩ parallel to 1500 Ω. This equivalent to (1000 x 1500)/(1000 + 1500),
which is 600 Ω. Now we can add the 300 Ω, making 900 Ω. The current is therefore
6 volts/ 900 Ω, which is 6.7 mA.

A.C. Circuits
In the Intermediate Manual, we looked at the behaviour of capacitors and inductors when
alternating current is applied. We de ned the term reactance for their opposition to A.C.
For capacitors, the reactance decreases with increasing frequency, while for inductors the
reactance increases with increasing frequency. We explained why the current and voltage
are not in phase with each other, a requirement for the Full syllabus. We went on to show
that resonance occurs in a circuit when the reactance of the capacitor equals the
reactance of the inductor. Impedance was introduced for these circuits.
In the Full Manual, we look at the formulae for the reactance of capacitors and inductors.
We nd out what happens if a resistor is included in the circuit by using phasor diagrams.
We see that crystals can exhibit series and parallel resonance. We learnt about
transformers in the Intermediate Manual but here we use the formula to calculate the step
up or step down voltage. There are a lot of formulae in this chapter, but you do not have
to remember them as they are provided in the examination.

Reactance formula for a capacitor
In the Intermediate Manual, page 50, we explained the behaviour of a capacitor to
alternating current and explained why the current leads the voltage.
The reactance of a capacitor is given by

Xc = 1/(2 π f C)
This formula tells us that the reactance of the capacitor is inversely proportional to both
the frequency and the capacitance. If we double the frequency, the reactance is halved.
This is because there are more charging, discharging cycles each second. Also with a
bigger capacitor, more charge can be stored and released in each cycle.
In the Intermediate, we measured the reactance from the formula V/I. Now we can check
that result with the values of the signal generator frequency, and the capacitance of the
capacitor.
For example, a 100 F capacitor is connected to an AC supply voltage of 5 mV at a
frequency of 100 Hz. What current will ow in the circuit?
The impedance Xc is 1/ (2 π 100 x 100 x 10 -6.)
We are left with
Xc = 1/ (2 π 0.1) = 1.6 Ω
Therefore the current = V/ Xc = 5 m / 1.6 = 3.1 mA
Activity 3.1 The Reactance of a Capacitor.

Reactance formula for an inductor
We explained the behaviour of an inductor to alternating current and explained why the
current lags the voltage.
The reactance of an inductor is given by

XL = 2 π f L

51
This formula tells us that the reactance of the inductor is proportional to both the
frequency and the capacitance. If we double the frequency, the reactance is doubled.
Likewise doubling the inductance doubles the reactance.
In the Intermediate, we measured the reactance from the formula V/I. Now we can check
that result with the values on the signal generator frequency and the inductance of the
inductor.
For example, a 100 mH inductor is connected to an AC supply voltage of 5 mv at a
frequency of 100 Hz. What current will ow in the circuit?
The impedance XL is (2 π 100 x 100 x 10 -3.)
We are left with
XL = (2 π 10) = 62.8 Ω
Therefore the current = V/ Xc = 5m / 62.8 = 0.08 mA
Activity 3.2 The Reactance of an Inductor.

Phasor diagrams
We have seen that we can describe waves using the mathematical functions of sine and
cosine in the time domain. We have seen that the frequency domain using the Fourier
Transform has its advantages in analysing waves. A third alternative is phasor diagrams,
and yes, they do make life easier!
A phasor is a quantity consisting of two distinct parts - a magnitude and a phase angle,

φ, pronounced as , as in do the dog. That’s all. Simple. The advantage comes when we
include other quantities.
For example, an AC power supply would be represented by a phasor diagram as shown
at some instant in time, with the phasor rotating anti-clockwise. The actual voltage at any
instant is given as the projection on the x axis.

Resistor
We know that the current and voltage are in phase with each other for a resistor.
Therefore the phasor diagram for a resistor has both phasors along the x axis.

Capacitor
The voltage lags the current by a phase of 90 degrees. The current is the reference
phasor along the x axis.

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

53

inductor
The voltage leads the current by a phase of 90 degrees. Again the current is the reference
phasor along the x axis.

CR circuit
If we have a resistor in series with the capacitor, the phasor diagram looks like this:

Vs = VR + Vc
Note that this is an addition of phasors, each having its own phase, so it is not a simple
addition. We can do the calculation graphically or convert them into vectors.
Therefore, using Pythagoras,

Vs = √(V2R + V2C)

For example, if the magnitude of VR = 3 v and Vc = 4 v, what is the magnitude of Vs?
Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

54
We have the classic 3, 4, 5 triangle, 32 + 42 = 52.
Therefore Vs = 5 v.
We could calculate the phase angle φ too.

VR = I x R and Vc = I x Xc, so
Vs = I x Z
Where Z is the impedance of the circuit, given by

Z = √(R2 + X2C )
For example, R = 100 Ω and the reactance, Xc = 300 Ω, what is the impedance in the
circuit?
Z is not 400 Ω! It is √(1002 + 3002 ) Ω = 316 Ω.
LR circuit
For an inductor in series with a resistor, the phasor diagram is:

Vs = VR + VL
Again, note that this is an addition of phasors, each having its own phase, so it is not a
simple addition. We can do the calculation graphically or convert them into vectors.
Again, using Pythagoras,

Vs = √V2R +V2L)
VR = I x R and VL = I x XL, so
Vs = I x Z
Where Z is the impedance of the circuit, given by

Z = √(R2 + X2L)

RLC circuit

In the RLC circuit we have an AC source with an inductor, capacitor and resistor in series.
Because all the components are in series, the current is the same through each. The
voltage across the resistor is in phase with the current. The magnitudes of the voltages
across the inductor and capacitor are not equal. By Kirchho ’s voltage law, the voltage of
the source Vs must equal the sum of the voltages across the R, L and C.

Vs = VR + VL + Vc
Note that this is an addition of phasors, each having its own phase, so it is not a simple
addition. We can do the calculation graphically or convert them into vectors.

Vs = I x Z
Where Z is the impedance and I is the current in the circuit.

Z = √ {R2 + (2πfL - 1/2πfC)2 }
We can see that if XL = Xc then we are left with Z = R. We have resonance!

ff

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

56
For example, the magnitudes of VR = 3.4 v, VL = 6.28 v and Vc = 6.28 v. What is Vs?
It looks like a horrible calculation, but it is not! The voltages across the inductor and
capacitor are the magnitudes, but because they are opposite in sign, they cancel.
Therefore we are left with just VR. The voltage of the source is also 3.4 v.
What if the reactances of the inductors and capacitor are not equal?
For example, XL = 1000 Ω and Xc = 600 Ω and R = 300 Ω, what is Z?
XL - Xc = 1000 - 600 = 400 Ω
Again, we have the 3, 4, 5 triangle, so Z = 500 Ω.

Calculating the resonant frequency
At Intermediate, we found the resonant frequency of an RLC circuit by plotting a graph of
current against frequency to nd the maximum current. Now we can calculate the
resonant frequency and compare it with the measured value.
Resonance occurs when the reactance of the capacitor equals the reactance of the
inductor.

XL = Xc
2πfL = 1/2πfC

f = 1/(2π √(LC))

Rearranging, we get

For example, L = 100 mH and C = 1000 F,
Therefore, LC = 100 x 10 -3 x 1000 x 10 -6
= 10 -4
The square root of 10 -4 is 10 -2
Therefore the resonant frequency is 1/(2π 10 -2), which is 50/π = 16 Hz.
Activity 3.3 nding the resonant frequency and comparing it with the calculated value
You are expected to nd L or C, given the frequency. I think this is unfair as the formula
for L or C are not provided. Even I would be challenged to rearrange it, and don’t ask me
to learn it! If you get a question like this, you have three options:
a) ignore it and make an intelligent guess.
b) Use the values of the choices to nd f, to see if there is a match. However this would
be time consuming.
c) Rearrange the formula. You have to square everything to get rid of the square root. So
it becomes
f2 = 1/(4π2 LC)
If you are asked to nd L, then L swaps with f2
L = 1/(4π2 f2 C)
C = 1/(4π2 f2 L)

Parallel resonance
In a parallel RLC resonant circuit, the impedance graph is the opposite to that of series
resonance with a peak impedance at the resonant frequency. Therefore the current is a
minimum at resonance. The voltages across the capacitor and inductor are equal and
opposite so they cancel, but again the voltages can be quite high. The capacitor and
inductor exchange energy between the electric and magnetic elds, just as they do in the
series resonant circuit.

In summary,
Series resonance = low impedance
Parallel resonance = high impedance.

58

Q factor
At intermediate we saw the series resonance curve where the impedance is simply
resistive because the impedances of the capacitor and inductor cancel. The quality Q
factor of the resonance curve is a measure of its sharpness as we do not want a broad
response curve.
Q in terms of component values
One way of de ning Q for series resonance is as the ratio of the reactance of either the
capacitor or inductor to the resistance.

Q = X/R for series resonance
This is a good de nition because the inductance is related to the store of either magnetic
or electric energy while the resistance represents the wasted energy as heat. With more
resistance the Q factor becomes lower, which is not so good. As both X and R are
measured in ohms, Q is just a number.
(The formula for parallel resonance is the opposite, but it is not in the speci cation.)
For example, the resonance of a series RLC circuit occurs when the reactance of the
capacitor and inductor are equal at 1200 Ω. If the resistance in the circuit is 50 Ω, what is
the Q factor? Q = X/R = 1200/50 = 24.
If resistance is now 40 Ω, how does this change the Q factor? Q = X/R = 1200/40 = 30.
The formulae for the Q factor in terms of the component values of C and L are given in
the speci cation. For the sake of completeness, they are Q = 2πfL/R or 1/2πfCR.
It can be shown that the Q factor is also the ratio of the voltage of either the capacitor or
inductor, as they are equal, to the voltage of the supply. This is quite terrifying! The
voltages across the components and currents in the circuit can be so high that arcing and
melting of solder can occur! Components need to be rated for these high voltages,
particularly capacitors.

Q in terms of bandwidth

fi

fi

fi

fi

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

59
Points f1 and f2 on the graph are the frequencies where the current is 0.707 of the
maximum value Imax. The power in the circuit is given by I2 x R, so the power at f1 and f2
is (0.707Imax)2 R = 0.5 Imax2 R, that is, half the power at the resonant frequency fr.
Therefore these are called the half-power points. Alternatively the frequencies occur at
the -3 dB points. The di erence between the frequencies, f2 - f1, is called the bandwidth.
It can be shown that the Q factor can be given as

Q = fr/(f2 - f1)
We want a high Q factor in a circuit, so the bandwidth should be small. This formula is
true for series and parallel resonance.
For example, at 10 kHz we require a bandwidth of 80 Hz. What component values are
needed for L and C if R is 5 Ω?
Q = fr/(f2 - f1) = 10,000/80 = 125. Because Q is also X/R for series resonance, X = Q x R =
125 x 5 = 625. Knowing the reactance of the capacitor and inductor we can calculate
their values of capacitance and inductance, as the resonant frequency is given.

Dynamic resistance
The voltage and current in the resonant circuits are not out of phase, they are in phase.
This is true for both series and parallel resonance. The impedance in the circuit is
resistive, which must include the resistances of the capacitor and inductor. If Ir is the
current at resonance, it is useful to de ne the dynamic resistance RD by

RD = V/Ir = L/CR
(The units of L/C are Ω x Ω)
where R is the total resistance of the circuit. We can substitute into the Q factor formula.
Q = X/R = 2πfL/R. But R = L/C RD. The L’s cancel, leaving Q = 2πfCRD.
(If we use the reactance of the capacitor, Q = 1/R2πfC. But R = L/C RD. The C’s cancel,
leaving Q = RD/2πfL. This formula is not given in the Examination Materials.)
Note: for parallel resonance, the formulae are di erent because Q is de ned di erently.

Crystal resonance
We met the ability of quartz crystals to resonate at Intermediate level. We saw that they
have a very stable resonant frequency and a very high Q factor, even up to a million.

You need to be able to recall the equivalent circuit of a crystal, as shown in the diagram.
It has a capacitor C1, inductor L and resistor R in series, all parallel to another capacitor
C2, which arises from the capacitance between the electrodes sandwiching the crystal.
The crystal oscillator can be used in a series resonance circuit or a parallel resonance
circuit, but these are not interchangeable. In a series circuit, the impedance is reduced to
a minimum. In the parallel circuit, the impedance is a maximum at resonance. When using
a quartz crystal resonator, it will be for one or the other circuit, so care must be taken to
achieve the correct frequency.
A crystal oscillator can be purchased from Mouser (https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/
2/96/008-0309-0-786275.pdf) It can be seen on the data sheet that the frequency can be
speci ed to the sixth decimal place. The operating mode can be the fundamental or the
3rd overtone.

Mutual inductance
If a current changes in one coil it can induce an emf in a coil nearby. Similarly with a
primary circuit and a secondary circuit in a transformer, as we met at Intermediate. Mutual
inductance can be de ned by how quickly the current changes in the rst coil and as a
result how much emf is induced in the other coil. The changing current can be either as a
dc supply is switched on or o , or from an alternating current supply.
Activity 3.5 demonstrate mutual inductance.
The current in the secondary coil is caused by the changing magnetic eld it nds itself in.
The magnetic eld lines cut through the windings of the coil. The emf is produced by
electromagnetic induction.

Transformers
We can calculate the voltages in a transformer if we know the number of turns on the
primary Np and secondary Ns. If the primary voltage is Vp, the secondary voltage is given
by

Vs/Vp = Ns/Np

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

61
For example, what is the secondary voltage on a transformer if there are 50 turns on the
secondary and 1000 on the primary, with an input voltage of 240 volts.
Ns/Np = 50/1000 = 1/20. This is therefore a step down transformer. The output voltage Vs
= 1/20 x 240 = 12 volts.
A transformer does not increase the power, in fact the output power is less than the input
due to energy losses. In this example, the voltage has been reduced but the current will
increase by a factor of 20. The formula for the current is given by Ip/Is = Ns/Np.
The transformer can also change the impedance. If Zs is the secondary impedance and
Zp is the primary, they are related by the squares of the number of turns.
Zp = Zs x (Np/Ns)2
For example, a load of 200 Ω impedance is connected to a transformer with a secondary
to primary turns ratio of 5:1. What is the primary impedance? Np/Ns = 1/5.
Therefore (Np/Ns)2 is 1/25 and so Zp = 1/25 x 200 = 8 Ω.
At RF, at frequencies around 1 MHz, transformers use ferrite cores, which are
polycrystalline oxides containing manganese, zinc, nickel, copper and iron. Ferrites are
ceramic materials, so they are brittle and mechanical stress needs to be considered. They
can handle a lot of power for their size. Di erent cores are used at di erent frequencies,
depending on their use, so a transformer must be used at its speci ed frequency.
Losses can occur in the core which will heat the transformer. This is the case when the
magnetic ux density and frequency are high. This has implications for the power
handling of the transformer and its physical size.
Iron core transformers have a laminated core with insulation between the layers to reduce
induced currents in the core. These currents are called eddy currents because they don’t
have a direct path.

Answers on A. C. Circuits
1. The graph should show the current leading the voltage.
2. The capacitor continually charges and discharges in an AC circuit. When the voltage is
zero current either ows on or o the capacitor. When the voltage is a maximum the
capacitor is fully charged so no current ows.
3. When the change in current is zero, which happens when it is a maximum, there is no
induced voltage. However when the current is zero it is changing at its most rapid rate so
the induced voltage is a maximum.
4. The reactance = 1/2πfC = 1/(2 x π x 1000 000 x 1/1,000,000) = 1/2π Ω.
5. The reactance = 2πfL = 2 x π x 1,000,000 x 10/1000 = 2π10,000 = 20π kΩ.
6. We need to nd the resonant frequency.
L x C = (10/1000) x (1/1,000,000) = 1/100,000,000
√LC = 1/10,000. Therefore 1/√LC = 10,000
The frequency f = 1/2π√LC = 10,000/2π = 5/π kHz
7. The resonant frequency will a) decrease b) increase.
8. The Quality factor Q = 2πfL/R = (2 x π x 5/π x 1000 x 10/1000) /1 = 100 which is OK.
9. Q = f/(di erence). Therefore the di erence = f/Q = 10,000,000/50 = 200 kHz.
10. The Q is given by X/R where X = the reactance of the capacitor = 1/2πfC
= 1/2π10,000 x 5/1,000,000 = 1,000,000/2π10,000x5 = 10/π
Therefore Q = (10/π)/10 = 1/π
Better to use standard form, rather than using all those zeroes!
11. Zp = Zs x (Np/Ns)2. Therefore Zp/Zs = 500/8 = 62.5.
(Np/Ns)2 = 62.5. Therefore Np/Ns = 7.9 = 8:1

Semiconductors
In this chapter we study transistors in more detail, nding out how they behave and how
they can be used in ampli ers. We look at diodes for use in power supplies. Also the eld
e ect transistor is introduced.

Zener diode
Normally diodes do not conduct when reverse biased, apart from a small leakage current.
In fact if the reverse voltage is increased too much, the breakdown voltage will be
reached and the diode will be damaged. However a Zener diode is designed to conduct
when reverse biased. Its symbol is shown, together with its characteristic graph.

As the reverse current is increased, the resistance of the diode decreases. There comes a
point where the voltage remains constant. This property is used to regulate voltages,
allowing a current to ow when reverse biased, up to its breakdown voltage. The diode is
connected parallel to the supply voltage.

Activity 4.1 investigate a Zener diode.

NPN and PNP transistors
Transistors can be bipolar, meaning that they use both P-type and N-type
semiconductors. They either have two P-N junctions, or unipolar with one P-N junction, of
which the eld e ect transistor (FET) is an example.
We looked at the construction of a transistor in the Intermediate manual and saw how it
can be used either as a switch or an ampli er.
As a reminder, these are the typical currents through the transistor.
If IE = the current through the emitter

IC = the current through the collector
IB = the current through the base, then
IE = IB + IC
IB is very small, typically 5 μA, IC is 0.995 mA, so IE is 1 mA.
VBE is the potential di erence between the base and emitter.
VCE is the potential di erence between the collector and emitter.

Transistor characteristics
We need to do an investigation to see how a transistor behaves when we change the
voltages in the circuit. The activity explains where to purchase transistors and how to set
up the circuit to investigate the characteristics. This is the circuit I used for the activity.

Activity 4.2 characteristics of an NPN transistor in the common emitter mode
Input characteristics
We vary the voltage applied to the base VBE, measure the base current IB, but keep the
voltage to the collector VCE constant. We can see the graph is similar to the PN junction
diode characteristics, but the base current is very small and does not ow until VBE is
greater than 0.6 v.

The input resistance is the reciprocal of the slope of the graph, and as it is very steep, this
means that the input resistance is very low.
Input resistance = V/I = (0.8 - 0.6)V/150 μA
= 0.2 x 1,000,000/150 = 1333 Ω = 1.3 kΩ

Output characteristics
Keeping the base current at a xed value, we measure the collector current for increasing
VCE.
We can see that there is a knee or sharp bend in the curve. The transistor needs to be
operating above this knee as an ampli er. Below the knee it can become a switch. The
collector current stays fairly constant for a given base current and is hardly a ected by
the collector voltage.

ff

fi

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

69
Because the slope is not steep, in fact it is very shallow, this indicates that the output
resistance is high.
The output resistance at IB = 30 μA = V/I = (3.0 - 1.0)/10 mA = 1000 x2/10
= 200 Ω
which seems a little on the low side.
Transfer characteristics
Here we measure the collector current as the base current is varied, keeping the VCE
constant. The graph on the left is my rst attempt! I did not realise that the transistor had
reached saturation so soon. The graph on the right shows the linear relationship between

IC and IB, until saturation is reached.
We can calculate the gain β, pronounced bee-ta, the ratio of IC to IB, which is the slope of
the graph. We can use the term hfe for the gain.
When the collector current is 1 mA the base current is 4 μA.
β = IC/IB = 1 mA/4 μA = 250
PNP transistors are in the speci cation, so it is worthwhile investigating them. The
di erence in biasing is that a negative voltage is applied to the base. There are plenty of
PNPs to choose from in the transistor package from Hobby Components.

Biasing
This is the simplest biasing circuit where RB is chosen to provide the correct current to the
base. RL is the load resistor which will determine what base current is needed.

We use the output characteristics graph to help us decide what the quiescent conditions
should be. Quiescent here means what currents and voltages should be present before
the signal is applied.

A base current in the middle of the graph will allow variations above the knee of the graph
when the signal is applied. A load line is drawn on the graph with a slope equal to the
reciprocal of the load resistor.
Using my measured values, I chose 30 μA for the base current and 1 kΩ for the load
resistor, RL. This meant Q would be as shown on the graph. I need to make Vce about
half the supply voltage, a 9 volt battery, so that when a signal is introduced, Vce will
swing about that voltage. If it goes too high or too low, the signal would be clipped.
So what should RB be?
The base current = 30 μA
Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

71
So RB = (9 - 0.6)v /30 μA = about 3/10 MΩ. = 300 kΩ
I used a 330 kΩ resistor.
The gain hfe = 1 mA/4 μA = 250
Collector current = hfe x base current
Therefore Ic = gain x IB = 250 x 30 μA = 7.5 mA
Voltage across R, VR = collector current x RL = 7.5 mA x 1 kΩ = 7.5 v

Ampli ers
We are ready now to build our rst common emitter ampli er, using the circuit diagram
shown.

Activity 4.3 build an ampli er and measure its voltage gain and frequency response.

I used a signal generator and a dual beam oscilloscope and these are the values I
obtained.
Voltage gain
Input voltage = 20 mv peak to peak
Output voltage = 2 v peak to peak
Voltage gain = 2/0.02 = 100
With signal o , VCE = 2.8 v
With signal, varies from 1.7 to 3.9 v, with the opposite phase to the input.
Frequency response
Half voltage at 9 Hz to 360 kHz.

How the ampli er works
The transistor is biased at DC with steady values of current and voltage. Along comes the
oscillating input. When the positive half of the cycle is applied to the base, the base
current increases as does the collector current. The voltage across the load increases but
the voltage across the transistor decreases. The opposite happens on the negative half of
the signal.

Therefore the signal is ampli ed and reversed in phase to the input. The peak of the input
relates to the trough of the output.

Biasing problems
What is wrong with the simple biasing circuit in the diagram above?
Variation of gain
To see the problem of variation of gain, let’s take a supply voltage of 6 v, hfe = 100, and a
collector current of 2.0 mA.
voltage across RB = 6 - 0.6 v = 5.4 v, where 0.6 v is the forward bias voltage
of base-emitter junction.
IC = hfe x IB.

IB = IC /hfe = 2.0 mA/100 = 20 μA
RB = V/I = 5.4/20 μA = 270 kΩ
Fine! But what happens if a di erent transistor is used with a gain of 200? The collector
current will no longer be 2.0 mA. IB is unchanged, but IC will be twice as much, 4.0 mA,
giving a larger voltage drop across RL, leaving too little voltage variation for the transistor.
The problem is that the collector current is proportional to the gain.
Stabilising the collector current
In the improved biasing circuit we have added RE. Now an increase in collector current will
cause an increase in the voltage across the emitter, this in turn will reduce the forward
bias of the base-emitter junction. The base current is reduced as is the collector current.
A similar feedback situation occurs if RB is connected from the base to below RL.

ff

fi

fi

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

73

However the gain is reduced when signals are applied to the transistor as some voltage is
lost through RE.
Even better biasing circuit
A capacitor is connected across RE. This acts as a short circuit for the alternating current

signal. The DC quiescent point is stabilised and the gain is stabilised too. The capacitor is
known as a decoupling or bypass capacitor.
In the circuit diagram above for investigating the transistor, two further capacitors are
shown acting as DC blocking capacitors.

Di erent modes
Because the transistor has three terminals there are three di erent ways of connecting the
input to the transistor. They are shown in the diagram - common base, common emitter
and common collector.

‘Common’ here means the transistor terminal is common to the input and the output,
such as the case of being grounded.
Common base mode has no current gain, only voltage gain. The output is in phase with
the input. It is used to match a low resistance to a high resistance.

ff

ff

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

74

Common emitter mode is usually used for ampli ers.
Common collector, or emitter follower, is used in bu er stages to match a high resistance
to a low resistance. It bu ers or protects a following circuit.
The output follows the input, with no voltage gain, only current gain.

Activity 4.4 investigate the characteristics of common base and common collector.

Classes of bias
Depending on the bias or operating point, there are several classes of bias - class A,
class B, class AB and class C.
We can see the di erences in the transfer graphs for each of them.
Class A
In class A the transistor is biased at the mid-point of the linear part of the output
characteristics. This means the output will be faithful copy of the input. There will be no
distortion. This is the class we have been using so far with the ampli er.
The downside of class A is that current is still passing in the transistor with no input.
Therefore the e ciency is low. This bias is used for low power small signal audio
frequency ampli ers, such as car radios.

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

75
Class B
We can achieve greater e ciency and output power by operating in class b, where the
transistor is biased at the cut-o point. However distortion will occur as only one half of
the cycle is ampli ed. This can be overcome by operating two transistors with class B
bias in a push-pull arrangement. Class B is used in audio power ampli ers and tuned
radio frequency ampli ers.

Class AB

For class AB the bias point is between the mid-point and the cut-o point. The positive
cycle is ampli ed but the negative cycle is not completely ampli ed. This makes class AB
more e cient than class A with less distortion than class B, so it is used in audio power
ampli ers.
Class C
Here the transistor is biased beyond the cut-o . Current ows in the load for less than
half the input signal. There is much distortion. However class C nds uses in tuned radio
frequency power ampli ers and oscillators because the transistor is acting as a high
frequency switch.

More transistor circuits
There is a lot of fun to be had with transistor circuits, if you have the time. Another circuit
you could investigate is the single stage RF ampli er. This has a tuned circuit in the load
so that a narrow band of frequencies is ampli ed.
The single stage wideband ampli er has a peaking coil in the load, which has the e ect of
extending the upper cut-o frequency. This allows the ampli er to deal with nonsinusoidal signals such as square waves.
The bu er ampli er is another ampli er that could be constructed.
There is plenty of advice here (http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Projects/)

Field e ect transistor, FET
The eld e ect transistor family consists of the junction eld e ect transistor, JFET, and
the metal oxide semiconductor eld e ect transistor, MOSFET, also known as the
insulated gate eld e ect transistor, IGFET. You can buy P or N channel versions.
The symbol and cross-section of an N channel JFET is shown in the diagram.

With no voltage applied two deletion layers are formed at the PN junctions. When bias
voltages are applied there is a negative voltage applied to the gate Vgs and a positive
voltage to the drain Vds.
With Vgs = 0 volts, electrons are attracted from the source to the drain as Vds is
increased. However the depletion layers widen until the current becomes zero, called the
pinch o point. Increasing the negative gate voltage allows the gate to control the current
to the drain and at what voltage that the pitch o point occurs.
The gate source junction is e ectively a reverse biassed junction. This results in one of
the advantages of the FET, that it has a high input impedance.
Activity 4.5 investigate the transfer characteristics of an FET
Activity 4.6 construct an FET ampli er
In the activities, make sure that the gate is always negative with respect to the source. If it
were made positive, the current would ow into the gate and damage the FET.

Dual gate FET
The symbol is shown in the diagram.

Having two gates means that it can be considered as a two stage ampli er in one. It is
used in radio receivers, RF mixers and multipliers.
The usual con guration is as a common source ampli er with gate 1, G1 connected to
the input and the second gate, G2 grounded via the capacitor.

Stabilising circuits
A regulated power supply (or linear voltage regulator) provides a constant DC output from
an unregulated DC input. If the load varies, no matter, the DC output remains the same.
It achieves this by taking a feedback voltage from the output, comparing it with a
reference voltage from the Zener diode and controlling the input with the required
correction.
Feedback
The feedback voltage is taken from the potential divider at the output.
Error voltage
The Zener diode provides the xed reference voltage, so the error voltage is the
di erence between that and the feedback voltage.
Pass transistor

The pass transistor is between the unregulated input and regulated output and is acts as
the controller. The error voltage is applied to another transistor. If the output goes high the

fi

error voltage at the base of the pass transistor brings the output back to the regulated
voltage.

E ciency
A voltage regulator can be quite ine cient, especially if the input voltage Vin is high, such
as 10 v, and the output voltage Vout is low, 6 v. The power loss is given by
power loss, P = I x (Vin - Vout)
If the supply current is 1 A,
P = 1 x (10 - 6) = 4 W
The e ciency is Pout/Pin = 6/10 = 60% with 40 % wasted. Hence the need for a heat
sink!

IC Regulator
A voltage regulator can be bought from Farnell Ltd
(https://uk.farnell.com/c/semiconductors-ics/power-management-ics-pmic/voltageregulators)
It has a hole in the aluminium plate to x it to a heat sink. The three terminals are input,
output and the common ground.

Peak Inverse Voltage PIV and Recti er Diodes
The peak inverse voltage rating of a recti er diode is the maximum voltage that is
permitted across it. Any more, and it would breakdown.
When a recti er is used with a capacitor, the PIV will be twice the peak voltage of the
output, because the voltage across the transformer and capacitor add. For example, if
230 volts RMS are required, the peak value is 230 x 1.414 = 325 v, so twice the peak
value is 650 v. Therefore the rating should be about 700 v or higher.

Switch mode power supply
The switch mode power supply was introduced at Intermediate level. Here you need to
know the block diagram and their functions.
It provides a regulated output by using switching circuits, making it more e cient than
linear power supplies. The input is AC and the output is DC.
It relies on pulse width modulation PWM, a technique used by primary aged school
children to change the brightness of an LED with a BBC microbit.
The block diagram is shown with the waveforms at each stage.

The AC input is recti ed and ltered to give a DC smoothed output. It is fed to the power
transistor which acts as a high frequency switch at around 50 kHz. It chops the DC into
pulses which are fed to the high frequency transformer. The voltage is stepped down to
the required low voltage. The output is fed to a recti er and lter unit. The control circuit
compares the DC output with the reference value. If it is too high the chopping frequency
is decreased, reducing the output power, and vice versa. The pulse width modulator
controls the width of the pulses, the on and o times.
The advantages of a switch mode power supply are that it is e cient (https://
www.hamradio.co.uk/alinco-dm-330fx-30-amp-switch-mode-power-supply-with-usbports-pd-690), there is less heat wastage, it is small due to the high frequency
transformer, and the output voltage can be varied.
The disadvantages are that the switching can produce harmonics and RF interference. A
good quality unit requires proper ltering and screening.

the Rapid meter measuring the collector current and the Velleman meter measuring the

It wasn’t easy getting nice round values for the base current, such as 10, 20, 30 μA , so I
used values near enough.
The results for the base and collector currents show that I was immediately in the
saturation zone, so I had to go back and repeat measurements for the linear part of the
characteristics.

Questions on semiconductors
1. When you purchase a Zener Diode you need to know its Zener voltage. What is that?
2. Where do Zener diodes nd applications?
3. How is a Zener Diode di erent to an ordinary diode?
4. A 9.1 v Zener Diode is in series with a resistor R to form a potential divider with a
stabilised output on the load resistor. The input voltage is 15 v. The minimum current for
the diode is 1 mA and the maximum current through the load resistor is 20 mA. What is
there required value of resistor R?
5. How is biasing di erent for a PNP transistor?

Answers
1. The Zener voltage is the reverse breakdown voltage which will be across the diode

when it is reverse biased, maintaining a constant voltage drop.
2. Zener diodes are used in voltage regulators where a stable supply is required. They are
also used in clipper circuits
3. An ordinary diode would be damaged at the reverse breakdown voltage. A Zener Diode
e ectively conducts when forward and reverse biased.
4. The total current through resistor R is the load current plus the diode current = 1 mA +
20 mA = 21 mA.
The potential di erence across R is 15 - 9.1 volts = 5.9 v
Therefore the resistance of R = V/I = 5.9/21 mA = 281 Ω
5. For a PNP transistor the majority carriers are holes. Therefore all the currents are in the
opposite direction. A negative voltage is applied to the base.

Modulation
This chapter is all about phase and how it can be used to send digital signals. Phase was
introduced in the Intermediate manual in the chapter on Radio Waves and on page 87 of
Modulation. The phase of a signal indicates where it is in its cycle or oscillation. For
example, a phase of 180 degrees means it is half way. A phase of 360 degrees means it
has completed its oscillation or cycle.
Here we learn how phase modulation is achieved. Phasor diagrams are key and GNU
Radio helps us to visualise what is happening.
Forget Amplitude Modulation AM and Frequency Modulation FM, they are old hat. The
latest is I/Q modulation!

Phasor diagrams
We have seen the advantage of phasor diagrams in showing the phase relationships of
voltages and currents across resistors, capacitors and inductors. A phasor can show the
magnitude of a quantity such as the voltage across a resistor and its phase relative to the
current through a resistor. It is important to remember that a phasor is not a vector.
However the rules of vector addition can be used for phasors.
We can apply the same principles of phasor diagrams to radio waves.
On a phasor diagram a radio wave would have an amplitude, a frequency and a phase
relative to a reference. For example, a radio wave of 6 μv and 50 MHz, can be shown at
an instant in time t, when its phase is 45 degrees. The phasor is rotating 50 million times a
second. The projection on the y axis oscillates up and down, and its position with time is

plotted on the graph.

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

86

I and Q waveforms
How do phasor diagrams help us to understand the di erent kinds of modulation, and
phase modulation in particular? We need to introduce the concept of I and Q waveforms.
A radio wave can be produced by combining two waves which are out of phase by 90
degrees. E ectively, we are combining a sine wave with a cosine wave. The green wave is
a sine wave and the blue is a cosine wave. The resultant is the red wave. We can see that
its peak is halfway between the two waves, so its phase is 45 degrees.

The phasor diagram shows the green phasor along the x axis and the blue phasor along
the y axis. The resultant is the red phasor. The x axis is called the in-phase or incident or I

axis, while the y axis is the 90 degrees out of phase, or the quadrature Q axis. As the
phasors rotate, they keep their phase relationships.

The situation works in reverse. A signal, such as the red wave, can be expressed in terms
of its I and Q components.
Activity 5.1 use GNU Radio to show resultant of adding equal amplitude Q sine and I
cosine waves.
Phasor diagrams can explain amplitude modulation and frequency modulation, but the
real advantage comes when we consider phase modulation and its use in digital
communications.

Amplitude modulation
For AM, when we modulate a carrier wave with our voice, we are simply changing the
amplitude of the carrier. The phase is constant. The loudness of your voice determines
the change in amplitude. For example, a tone of 500 Hz, period 2 ms, modulates a 7.1
MHz carrier wave. In the phasor diagram the sidebands have their own mini phasor
diagram attached to the arrow head of the carrier, rotating once every 2 milliseconds,
during which time the carrier has rotated over 14 thousand times. The red upper sideband
rotates clockwise and the blue lower sideband rotates anti-clockwise. Their position
during one cycle is shown on the left, with the resultant of adding them. This resultant is

added to the carrier amplitude. At the start and end of the cycle, the carrier amplitude is
greater, while half way, at 1 ms, the amplitude is reduced.

Frequency modulation
For FM, your voice changes the frequency of the carrier. You are e ectively changing its
phase. This is shown on the phasor diagram with the side bands are right angles to the
carrier phasor, rotating in opposite directions.
For the same 500 Hz signal the positive cycle causes the frequency to be higher, while
the negative cycle causes it to be lower in frequency. Let’s say the carrier frequency is

145 MHz. In the two seconds of the audio signal there will be 290 millions oscillations of
the carrier wave. The red upper sideband frequency rotates anti-clockwise and the blue

89
lower sideband rotates clockwise. Their position during one cycle is shown on the left,
with the resultant of adding them. This resultant is at right angles to the carrier frequency
and changes its frequency but not the amplitude. At the start and end of the cycle, the
carrier frequency is greater, while half way, at 1 ms, the frequency is less.

Digital modulation
There are many advantages of digital modulation over analogue modulation. For example,
more information can be transmitted for less radio spectrum, the data can be processed
by computers and the quality is superior.
We saw in the Intermediate manual the di erent kinds of digital modulation. Common
examples are Frequency Shift Keying FSK and Phase Shift Keying PSK, but there are
many more such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying QPSK.

Phase modulation
Digital signals are streams of binary 1’s and 0’s. To send a digital signal we can denote
two di erent phases, such as zero and 180, to represent the 1’s and 0’s.
This can be shown on a phasor diagram, with two phasors, one at zero and one at 180
degrees, representing 1 and 0.

In practice, the phasor diagram is simpli ed by just changing the arrow head of the
phasor to a cross. This is now called a constellation diagram and the process is called
binary phase shift keying or BPSK.

In a Software De ned Radio transmitter, the local oscillator produces the I waveform and
a 90 degree phase shift produces the Q waveform.

The incoming data signals are mixed with the I and Q waveforms and then added to give
the modulated output. This is all done by digital signal processing, either by mathematical
processes in a computer or using dedicated hardware. The incoming signals can be
either the original RF signal or a sampled version.
In the receiver the modulated signal is sampled and the I and Q components are
extracted. They are then demodulated to produce the original data signal.

Complex modulations
In the activity above, the amplitude of the two I and Q waveforms was the same and the
phase of the resultant was 45 degrees. But what happens when we change the amplitude
of one of them?
Activity 5.2 use GNU Radio to show the resultant of adding Q sine and I cosine waves of
di erent amplitudes
By changing the amplitude of either the I or the Q waveforms we can achieve any phase
between 0 and 90. For example, if we make the amplitude of the blue Q wave really small,
the resultant red waveform will be nearer the green wave with a phase near 0 degrees.
Likewise, if the amplitude of the green I wave is made very small, the resultant will have a
phase nearer 90 degrees. If we want to have a wider range of phase shifts, from 0 to 360,
we need to invert the signals. This is beyond the speci cation, but we can see what
happens when we use negative amplitudes in this wiki website.

Activity 5.3 use GNU Radio to show the resultant of adding inverted Q sine and I cosine
waves to obtain a range of phases.
We can now send two binary digits at a time, making the communication faster and more
e cient in terms bandwidth. Therefore we have the following table:

Answers on Modulation
1. A phasor is a representation of a physical quantity showing its magnitude and phase.
2. A phasor diagram uses a coordinate system to show the relationship between phasors.
3. A vector has magnitude and direction, such as force, while a phasor has magnitude
and phase relative to a reference phasor.
4. When a wave experiences a phase change of 180 degrees the crests become troughs

5. When a wave experiences a phase change of 90 degrees the crests and troughs both
become zero.
6. If you combine a sine wave and a cosine wave of equal amplitude and frequency, you
obtain a wave of the same frequency, slightly greater amplitude and a phase at 45
degrees to the two waves.
7. To achieve a phase of 10 degrees you make the amplitude of the sine wave much
greater than the cosine wave. Similarly for 80 degrees, you make the amplitude of the
cosine wave greater than the sine wave.
8. The In-phase (I) component is produced by a local oscillator while the quadrature (Q)

9. Phase modulation and demodulation are carried out in SDR (software de ned radio)

11. If a voltage phasor has a phase of 45 degrees on the phasor diagram then the I and Q
components must be equal in magnitude.
12. Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) or 4 level Phase Shift Keying uses four phase
angles to represent binary signals. For example, 00 is zero phase, 01 is 90 degrees, 10 is
180 degrees and 11 is 270 degree phase.
13. For AM, the resultant of the sidebands is always in phase with the carrier, meaning
that the carrier frequency does not change, just its amplitude. For FM the resultant is not
in phase with the carrier, so the sidebands change the frequency of the carrier.

Transmitters
In the Intermediate manual, page 91, we looked at the di erent kinds of oscillator. Here
we consider digital techniques.
To build a radio transmitter you need oscillators, multipliers, mixers, modulators and
ampli ers. We will look at each in turn and see how they all work together in the di erent
kinds of transmitter.

Oscillators
At Intermediate level you studied the transistor oscillator, the quartz crystal oscillator and
the variable frequency oscillator and had a quick look at the Direct Digital Synthesiser,
which generates audio and RF signals from pre-set digital values held in a memory, or
Lookup Table. Now we will study digital oscillators in more detail.
The Phase Locked Loop PLL
In a phase locked loop synthesiser, the output frequency of the voltage controlled
oscillator is continuously compared to a xed reference oscillator. If there is a phase
di erence between them, then a voltage is produced to bring them back in phase. If the
output frequency drops slightly, there will be a phase lag. This lag is detected by the
phase detector which will produce a voltage. This voltage is ltered before passing to the
voltage controlled oscillator VCO where it corrects the frequency. Therefore the phase of
the two frequencies are locked.
The frequency of the reference oscillator fref and the frequency of the VCO fo both have to
be divided by an appropriate number to make them equal. For example if the reference
oscillator frequency, fref, is 6.000 MHz, it is divided by A = 6000, to reduce it to 1 kHz.
Similarly if the VCO frequency, fo is 10.000 MHz, it must be divided by N = 10,000. If the
output frequency of the VCO is changed to 10.500 MHz, it must now be divided by
10,500.
Therefore fref /A = fo/N = 1 kHz.
Direct Digital Synthesiser
The crystal oscillator acts a reference clock, controlling the number of samples every
second. For example, for a 10 kHz crystal, each sample takes 0.1 ms. The frequency
control sets the phase angle of each sample. If we take a phase angle of 200 there will be

18 samples, at 200, 400, 600 and so on to 3600. The Lookup Table has the required
amplitude values at those phase angles to generate a sine wave. The time taken for those
samples will be 18 x 0.1 ms or 1.8 ms. The sine wave for these samples will be 1/1.8 ms
or 555.5 Hz. Taking a bigger phase angle of 400, there will be 9 samples, taking 9 x 0.1 ms
or 0.9 ms, corresponding to a higher frequency of 1111.1 Hz.
The digital samples are fed to the digital to analogue converter, followed by a low-pass
antialias lter.

What can go wrong?
Instability and thermal drift
The stability of an oscillator was discussed in the Intermediate manual. Here we look at
the thermal e ects.
Oscillators experience thermal drift where their frequency changes as the temperature
increases. This could cause you to operate outside a band if you are near the edge of a
band or to transmit over another operator’s transmission. How would you know that you
are drifting? Has another operator told you that you are drifting? Is their receiver drifting?!

95
Component values of capacitance and inductance can change with temperature causing
the resonant frequency to change. A transmitter warms up after a while to a steady
temperature as the ampli ers and other units generate waste heat. However, the oscillator
should be designed not to be a ected by changes in temperature as your transmit. It
should be located away from heat sources. Its components should have temperature
coe cients such that any change in the values for L and C cancel out.
Parasitic oscillations
Parasitic or spurious oscillations are unwanted oscillations which result in emissions at
unpredictable frequencies. They are called parasitic because they take power for their
own use. They can occur at frequencies unrelated to the desired frequency and cause
severe interference to other radio users. Parasitic oscillations are due to stray capacitance
or inductance in RF ampli er stages and tend to occur above the operating frequency.
Self oscillations may occur at or near the operating frequency. The cure is to minimise the
feedback by screening the input and output circuits.
Also oscillations may occur at lower frequencies than the operating frequency due to
instability in the audio stages. To prevent any oscillation, chance resonances need to be
damped by adding a resistor and a DC blocking capacitor.
Phase noise
An ideal oscillator will produce a single frequency. In practice the lack of stability will
cause the phase of the frequency to change. This can be shown on a frequency domain
diagram with the phase noise, extending to positive and negative values beside the
output frequency. This noise will carry through to all the mixing circuits in the transmitter.
The output will be distorted and spread in frequency.

To give a measure of the phase noise, we need to specify the o set from the carrier
frequency. This could be 1 kHz, 10 kHz or 100 kHz depending on the carrier frequency.

96
Then we need to specify the bandwidth which is usually taken to be 1 Hz. Finally we
quote the amplitude of the phase noise in dB relative to the carrier, such as -60 dBc/Hz.

Multipliers
To understand why we need multipliers in a transmitter, we need to look at the frequency
bands. If an oscillator can produce the frequency range of 1.75 MHz to 2.0 MHz,
multipliers will generate the HF bands.
80 m, 3.5 MHz = 1.75 to 2.0 x 2
40 m, 7.0 MHz = 1.75 to 2.0 x 4
20 m, 14.0 MHz = 1.75 to 2.0 x 8
15 m, 21.0 MHz = 1.75 to 2.0 x 12
10 m, 28.0 MHz = 1.75 to 2.0 x 16
The theory of multipliers is very simple. We learnt about harmonics in the chapter on
Radio Waves in the Intermediate manual, page 16. A fundamental frequency will have
harmonics equal to twice, three times, four times and so on. A frequency multiplier circuit
will introduce harmonics on purpose, using a class C transistor or a semi-conductor
diode operating in a nonlinear fashion. This is followed by a tuned LC circuit to select the
required harmonic. Filters remove the fundamental and other harmonics. There’s just one
problem - the amplitude of the harmonics weaken for the higher orders, with the limit at
about the fourth harmonic.
The company Mini-Circuits will supply you with whatever frequency multiplier you require,
with output frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 40 GHz.
https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/Multipliers.html

Mixers
For the other frequency bands we mix two frequencies. We covered this in the
Intermediate manual, page 20, with a frequency domain diagram. if we mix a wave of
frequency f0 with a wave of frequency f1, we get the sum and di erence frequencies, f0 +
f1 and f0 - f1.
For example, the modulation has been carried out at 6 MHz but we want to transmit on 2
meters. Therefore we use a frequency synthesiser to generate 138 MHz which is mixed
with the 6 MHz. We want the sum 144 MHz and lter out the di erence, 132 MHz.
We need a crystal oscillator and variable frequency oscillator VFO and mix them together.

Modulators
The function of the modulator is to add the information, in the form of voice or data, to the
carrier radio frequency wave. We can do this either by changing the amplitude of the
signal or its frequency.
AM
An amplitude modulated signal has the carrier frequency and the two sidebands. The
upper sideband is the sum of the carrier frequency and the signal while the lower is the
di erence. For example, if the signal is 1 kHz and the carrier frequency is 6.0 MHz, the
upper sideband is the frequency 6.001MHz while the lower sideband is 5.999 MHz.

SSB
The modulator for Single Sideband, SSB, requires just one sideband and no carrier
frequency. This is achieved with a balanced modulator which suppresses the carrier
frequency, leaving the two sidebands. It is now a double sideband suppressed carrier
signal. A narrow band lter cancels any remaining carrier frequency and the unwanted
sideband.
FM
A modulator to produce frequency modulation has a varactor diode, which is a reversed
bias diode whose capacitance varies with the applied voltage. The audio input signal is
applied to the varactor diode, which forms part of a resonant oscillator. The oscillating
audio signal changes the capacitance of the varactor which in turn changes the resonant
centre frequency of the oscillator. For example, a 1 kHz signal and a carrier of 7.075 MHz,
with a deviation of 2.5 kHz, would oscillate from 7.0725 MHz to 7.0775 MHz, a thousand
times a second. The amplitude of the 1 kHz signal determines the deviation.

Ampli ers
The job of the ampli er is to increase the signal su ciently to drive the antenna or dummy
load. The requirements are di erent for the di erent kinds of modulation. If the ampli er is
an early stage ampli er it is called a driver.
For an FM transmitter, the signal amplitude is constant. A class C ampli er can be used
because we are not worried about distortion in the ampli cation. Class C ampli ers are
non-linear but this is not an issue if the amplitude does not change.
However, we are concerned with linearity for AM and SSB ampli ers. The ampli ed signal
must be a faithful reproduction of the original signal, allowing no distortion. Therefore we
nd class B linear ampli ers in AM and SSB transmitters.

RF power ampli er
The RF power ampli er must provide linear ampli cation for AM and SSB modes because
they require the modulated signal to match the audio signal. There must be no distortion.
This means the ampli er is a class A ampli er. It must not be over-driven, as this could
produce harmonics which would be outside the signal bandwidth. This is called splatter.

What can go wrong?
Over-modulating
Over-modulating a transmitter distorts the modulated audio signal as shown in the
Intermediate manual. This will cause harmonics of the audio. The audio is limited to 3
kHz, so they will be multiples of 2 or 3, giving 6 to 9 kHz, making the transmitted
bandwidth excessive.
With FM the equivalent problem is over-deviation, resulting in extra FM sidebands.
Similarly, there will be interference to adjacent channels.
Over-drive
Over-drive of the RF power ampli er will cause it to become non-linear. This will produce
harmonics, e ectively increasing the transmitted bandwidth. These harmonics will cause
intermodulation products.

Over-drive of an external power ampli er can also cause harmonics and intermodulation
products. Adjacent frequencies will su er from the splatter or spread of frequencies. The
remedy is to use the minimum power output.

Automatic Level Control, ALC
The function of the ALC is to prevent over-modulation by reducing the power during voice
peaks. A signal is fed back from the power ampli er to the transmitter. It is needed if you
have an external power ampli er to prevent over-driving.
There could be con ict if you have a manual RF power control. You cannot rely on the
ALC to control the output.
We will now look at the four kinds of transmitter.

CW transmitter
For CW, Morse code, when you press the Morse key, you are sending a carrier wave. A
dot is one millisecond’s worth, while a dash is three milliseconds. The turning on and o
of the carrier wave is performed by the keying stage, with a Morse key input. This stage is
followed by a power ampli er and a low pass lter.
The oscillator needs to be running continuously, as switching it on and o , would a ect
its frequency and cause chirp, which is a kind of chirping sound. This YouTube video
about the Channel CW tea party, has a good example two minutes in, https://
www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXz31LJp-iQ.
Similarly, we cannot switch the power supply on and o , as that would cause key-clicks.

AM transmitter

The basic block diagram is shown but it will have various mixers and multipliers, with the

addition of a low pass lter, which goes after the RF power ampli er, preventing higher
frequencies from passing.
The modulator mixes the audio signal with the carrier wave, producing the two
sidebands, both of which are transmitted, together with the carrier wave. Therefore the
bandwidth of AM transmission is 6 Hz.

SSB transmitter
The block diagram is the same as for the AM transmitter with an addition of a sideband
lter. For a SSB transmitter, we only transmit one sideband, reducing the bandwidth to 3
kHz. The balanced modulator produces both sidebands, but removes the carrier wave.
The carrier frequency is suppressed.
As we only want one sideband, the balanced modulator is followed by the sideband lter.
This lter needs to be quite precise as it is allowing a sideband to pass but blocking the
other sideband, which is very close. The lter needs to be highly selective.

FM transmitter
For frequency modulation, the audio signal changes the frequency of the carrier wave.
This is achieved with a variable capacitance diode, called a varicap diode. When a diode
is reverse biassed, no current ows. The amount of reverse bias can control the width of
the depletion layer, and therefore its capacitance. The diode is used in the oscillator
circuit to vary the frequency.
The AF ampli ed signal from the microphone is mixed with the RF oscillator.
This is followed by a bu er ampli er, a power ampli er and a low pass lter.

Transmitters Answers
1. An FM modulation index of 0.8 means that if the maximum audio frequency is 3kHz
then the peak deviation will be 0.8 x 3 = 2.4kHz.
2. a) Modulation Index = Actual deviation/peak deviation = 4k/2.5k = 1.6
b) the bandwidth = 2 x (maximum audio frequency + deviation) = 2 x (2.5 + 4) kHz = 13
kHz. With a 12.5 kHz channel spacing this would cause interference.
3. a) The 6 MHz oscillator mixes with the audio input to produce a frequency modulated
signal. b) The VFO then mixes with that signal to produce higher or lower frequencies as
desired. A lter is required to allow the desired frequency to pass.
4. A VFO with a range of (5 + 1.8) to (5 + 2.0) or 6.8 to 7.0 MHz is required. It will also
produce a range 11.8 to 12.0 MHz which will have to be ltered out.
5. We need two lots of multipliers each multiplying by 3. Therefore the other harmonics,
the doubling of the frequency, will need to be ltered.
6. The oscillator provides a xed master frequency which is divided by the xed divider.
The voltage controlled oscillator VCO also provides a frequency which is divided by the
programmable divider. The phase detector compares the phase of the two frequencies
and produces a DC voltage dependent on the phase di erence. This voltage is used then
to adjust and lock the frequency of the VCO.
For a PLL oscillator, if the crystal reference frequency is 6 MHz, A is 500 and N is 30,000,
the ratio fref /A = 6,000,000/500 = 12,000. Therefore the ratio fo/N is also 12,000.
Therefore fo = 12,000 x 30,000 = 360,000,000 = 360 MHz.
If the output frequency changes to 360.5 MHz, then the factor N must change too. To
keep the same output frequency it must change.
fo/N = 12,000. But fo = 360, 500,000. Therefore N = 360,500,000/12,000 = 30,042
To change the step size from 1 kHz to 100 Hz, the divider A has from 6,000 to 60,000.
The disadvantage of changing the step size to 10 Hz is that there will be only 10 chances
a second to alter the frequency, which would make the oscillator slow to respond.
7. A sine wave look up table sends signals to a digital to analogue converter and then to a
low pass lter to remove any harmonics. The frequency of the output depends on the
clock’s frequency. The purity of the signal will increase with the number of bits in the
converter.
Taking a phase angle of 100 there will be 360/10 = 36 samples.
If a 10 kHz crystal is used, the output frequency will be set by 36 x 0.1 ms = 3.6 ms.
Therefore the frequency will be 1/3.6 ms = 278 Hz.
If an oscillator can produce the frequency range of 1.75 MHz to 2.0 MHz, multipliers will
generate the HF bands by multiplying by 2, 4, 8, 12, 16. For example, multiplying by 8
gives the band 1.75 x 8 to 2.0 x 8 = 14 to 16 MHz or the 20 m band.
If an oscillator has an output of 10,000 to 12,500 MHz, to obtain an output of 20 to 25
GHz we simply need a frequency multiplier of two times.

If the input signal to the Sage SFA-283323318-28SF-E1 active frequency multiplier is 9.33
to 10.66 GHz and the output is 28.0 to 32.0 GHz, it is an X3 multiplier.
Two signals are at frequencies of 1 MHz and 0.75 MHz, so the two resultant signals will be
at 1.75 MHz and 0.25 MHz.
When a 2 kHz signal modulates an FM carrier of 7.075 MHz, with a deviation of 2.5 kHz,
the frequency will swing from 7.0725 MHz to 7.0775 MHz, two thousand times a second.
8. For amplitude modulation the carrier wave mixes with the audio signal so that the
amplitude of the carrier varies in sympathy with the audio signal. This produces two
sidebands, above and below the carrier frequency. If the highest frequency of the audio
signal is 3kHz the sidebands will be + or - 3kHz of the carrier. Therefore the bandwidth is
6Hz.
For SSB, one of the sidebands is removed so that the bandwidth is now 3kHz.
For frequency modulation the audio signal changes the frequency of the carrier wave in
sympathy with it. For example, if the audio signal is just 1kHz the frequency of the carrier
will change 1000 times a second. The amount of frequency change, or deviation,
depends on the amplitude of the audio signal. If the typical loudness causes a deviation
of 2.5kHz then the bandwidth is given by Carson’s rule: bandwidth = 2 x (maximum audio
frequency + deviation).
9. A linear ampli er is needed for AM and SSB as they rely on the amplitude changing in
sympathy with the audio signal so the output of the RF signal must match the audio. On
the other hand this is not the case for frequency modulation as the amplitude of the
carrier wave is unchanged.
10. Because linear ampli cation is required it must be a class A ampli er, which is linear
unless it is overdriven.
11. In g 7.19 it must be a class C ampli er as the base is held at 0v by the choke. In the
collector load there are a series of capacitors to lter any harmonics.
12. FM does not change in amplitude so the full power can be used. For SSB the
amplitude changes so the power output will change.
13. Speech processing limits the peaks so that the average power can be increased.
However this can increase the power consumption of the transmitter.

Receivers
To build a radio receiver you need oscillators, multipliers, mixers, demodulators and
ampli ers. We will look at each in turn and then see how they all work together in the
di erent kinds of receiver. Firstly, we will look at the requirements for a good receiver.

Speci cations
Sensitivity
The sensitivity of a receiver measures its ability to discern the weakest signal. For
example, the sensitivity of the Kenwood TS-890s receiver (https://www.kenwood.com/
usa/com/amateur/ts-890s/ ) is quoted for SSB as 0.2 μV for the range 1.705 to 24.5 MHz,
for a signal to noise ratio of 10 dB. This means that a signal of 0.2 μV produces a
discernible signal above the noise level, which is ten times the power of the noise.
For FM, the sensitivity is quoted as 0.22 μV for the range 28 to 30 MHz for 12 dB SINAD.
The ratio SINAD refers to the ratio of the signal to the noise and distortion, where any
distortion of the signal is added to the noise value. 12 dB means that the signal will be 16
times greater. (12 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 which converts to 2 x 2 x 2 x 2).
The weakest discernible signal can also be expressed in dBm, which is decibels with
respect to one milliwatt. 0 dBm is therefore 1 mW. +10 dBm is the same as 10 mW.
If the input impedance is 50 Ω, the power can be calculated from P= V x V/R. For a signal
of 0.5 μV, this converts to -113 dBm.
The signal to noise ratio, SNR, is de ned as
SNR = 10 log (power of signal/power of noise)
If the SNR = 10, that means log (power of signal/power of noise) = 1
In which case, the power of the signal = 10 x power of the noise.
An SNR of 10 dB is taken as the worst acceptable value. In audio engineering an SNR of
60 dB is considered good.
Because it is not always convenient to measure SNR directly, the related measurement
signal plus noise-to-noise ratio ([S+N]/N) is used. Mathematically, (S+N)/N = S/N+1. While
the relationship is simple when expressed as simple ratios, in dB, the di erence between
the two measurements depends on their value. For example, a ([S+N]/N) ratio of 3 dB
equates to an SNR of 0 dB. At the more usual level of 10 dB ([S+N]/N), the SNR is 9.54
dB. Another related measure that is increasingly popular is signal-plus-noise-plusdistortion to noise-plus-distortion ratio (SINAD). This measurement is essentially the same
as ([S+N]/N) with distortion included in the noise term. This is useful because, for most
users, the distortion is no more usable than the noise.
Selectivity
The selectivity of a receiver is important to ensure that only the desired frequency is
received. Nearby stations are rejected. This is achieved with a pass band lter. The lter
must have the correct bandwidth for a given signal. If it is too wide, other adjacent signals
will be able to pass through the lter. If is too narrow, some of the wanted signal will be
lost. Its performance can be given as plus or minus 4 kHz of the desired frequency at 60

dB, or one millionth of its peak value. For example the ICOM IC-7200 gives two options
for a built-in digital lter. You can select the lter width and shape from either soft or
sharp. The selectivity of the ICOM IC-7610 is given for a sharp lter at SSB for a
bandwidth of 2.4 kHz as more than 2.4 kHz/-6 dB, less than 3.6 kHz/-60 dB. ((https://
icomuk.co.uk/ les/icom/PDF/newsFile/IC-7610_Technical_Report_Vol1.pdf) Therefore the
receiver is able to reduce the signal to -60 dB or one millionth, 3.6 kHz from the centre
frequency of the lter. Minus 6 dB refers to a half of the the maximum value.
Dynamic range
As we have seen with the sensitivity gure, signals can be very weak, but they can also
be very strong. The dynamic range is the ability of the receiver to function satisfactorily
from the minimum to the maximum signal. It is measured in dB. The minimum value is
given by the sensitivity, such as 0.2 μV above. The maximum signal is the largest signal
which does not cause distortion. The Icom IC-7851 transceiver (https://icomuk.co.uk/
ic-7851/) ‘achieves a Reciprocal Mixing Dynamic Range of 110 dB’. Impressive! That’s a
power ratio of 100,000,000,000 or an amplitude ratio of 316,230. If the minimum is 0.2 μV,
then the maximum is 63 mV.

Mixers
Mixers are the key to receivers in producing a xed intermediate frequency, thereby
simplifying the ampli er design. For example, what local oscillator frequency f do we need
to produce an intermediate frequency of 500 kHz from a signal of 1.0 MHz?
f = 1000 + 500 = 1500 kHz
We have chosen to mix 1500 kHz with 1000 kHz, and to use the di erence frequency for
the local oscillator. Therefore the sum frequency, 1500 + 1000 = 2500 kHz, must be
ltered.

What could possibly go wrong?
Image frequency
If only it were that simple! There are a few complications.
There is another signal frequency that can produce an intermediate frequency of 500 kHz.
This is called the image frequency or image channel.
If the local oscillator is 1500 kHz, what frequency can mix with it to produce 500 kHz?
A signal at 2.0 MHz will too!
2000 - 1500 = 500 Hz.
The image frequency is twice the intermediate frequency higher than the local oscillator.

image frequency = (2 x IF) + local oscillator frequency
This image frequency must be ltered before it meets the mixer.
Another issue is whether to use a local oscillator frequency which is greater than the
signal frequency or lower. In the example above, the intermediate frequency is 500 kHz.
We can produce that frequency by mixing the signal with a local oscillator of a lower
frequency. For a signal of 1.0 MHz, we have
local oscillator frequency = 1000 - 500 = 500 kHz.
So, which is better? 1500 kHz or 500 kHz?
Let’s say the range of signals is 0.6 MHz to 1.6 MHz. In order to produce the intermediate
frequency of 500 kHz, the local oscillator must vary from
600 - 500 = 100 kHz to 1600 - 500 = 1100 kHz.
Therefore the local oscillator must range from 100 kHz to 1100 kHz.

105
For the higher local oscillator frequency, it must vary from
600 + 500 = 1100 kHz to 1600 + 500 = 2100 kHz.
Therefore the local oscillator must range from 1100 kHz to 2100 kHz.
While the range in both cases is the same, 1000 kHz, the ratio of the frequencies is less
for the higher local oscillator frequency, making its design easier. Also the image
frequency is further from the wanted frequency making it easier to lter out. The image
frequency is given by twice the intermediate frequency plus the local oscillator frequency.
A greater local oscillator frequency, 1500 kHz compared to 500 kHz, makes the image
frequency further from the wanted frequency.
Intermodulation products
There’s another problem!
We said that mixing two frequencies gives the sum and di erence frequencies. That’s ne
if the devices are linear. However if the receiver is overdriven, harmonics can occur and
we get extra frequencies, which are called intermodulation products. They are the sum
and di erence of the input frequencies and their harmonics.
If the input frequencies are f1 and f2, the intermodulation frequencies are given by
f = n f1 +/- m f2
where n and m are 1, 2, 3 etc.
For example, f1 = 1.0 MHz and f2 = 1.6 MHz. The lower harmonics of f1 are 2.0 MHz and
3.0 MHz. The higher harmonics tend to be less signi cant. For f2, the harmonics are 3.2
MHz and 4.8 MHz.
As a result of mixing, the extra frequencies, when adding, could be
(2 x 1.0) + 1.6 = 3.6 MHz
1.0 + (2 x 1.6) = 4.2 MHz
(3 x 1.0) + 1.6 = 4.6 MHz and so on.
When subtracting, we have
(2 x 1.0) - 1.6 = 0.4 MHz
(2 x 1.6) - 1.0 = 2.2 MHz
(3 x 1.0) - 1.6 = 1.4 MHz and so on.
(3 x 1.6) - (2 x 1.0) = 2.8 MHz.
The intermodulation products can be a nuisance. A strong input signal from a nearby
station can cause pick up on the frequency you are listening to. In the same band! To deal
with this problem the receiver needs to have a high dynamic range so that the strong
signals do not cause it to become non-linear.

Double superhet
Which is best? - a high intermediate frequency with image frequencies further from the
wanted signal or a low intermediate frequency where the cost and performance of low
frequency lters are superior and cheaper.
Why not use both? That is the principle of a double superheterodyne receiver. It uses a
high intermediate frequency to provide a high image frequency rejection for the initial
stage. For example, it could be as high as 60 MHz. The signal is then passed to a second
mixer to convert to the second lower intermediate frequency, such as 460 kHz.

Why stop at two? There are triple conversion superheterodyne receivers, such as the
ICOM IC-9100 (https://www.icomeurope.com/en/product/ic-9100/) for the 1200 MHz
band.

Demodulators and Detectors
AM
The simplest detector is the diode detector. The RF signal is recti ed.

Beat Frequency Oscillator
Morse code signals are simply a carrier wave, no carrier, a longer carrier wave, no carrier,
and so on. If there is no amplitude modulation, how do we get the familiar dits and dahs?
The answer is beats again. Inside the superheterodyne receiver is a beat frequency
oscillator, BFO, which oscillates at a frequency close to the intermediate frequency, which
in our case is 1.5 MHz. If the frequencies are 1 kHz apart, the di erence will be 1 kHz,
which is in the audio range. For example, if the BFO is at 1.501 MHz, the di erence is
1.501 - 1.500 = 0.001 MHz = 1 kHz. The BFO is adjustable, so that you can have di erent
tones for the Morse sound.

Single sideband audio
To recover single sideband audio, rather than use a diode to demodulate, we use a
special demodulator called a Product Detector. The incoming signal mixes with a local
oscillator, the Beat Frequency Oscillator. It produces a single frequency, rather than a
variable frequency, as for direct conversion. The sum and di erence frequency signals are
generated. The result is the original modulating signal. When mixing the frequencies, we
are e ectively multiplying them, so the word ‘product’ is applicable.

FM discriminator
In frequency modulation, the audio signal changes the frequency of the signal. The FM
discriminator is a detector which produces an output voltage that depends on the input
signal frequency. At the centre frequency the output is zero. If the frequency goes below
that value, the output is positive. If the frequency goes above, the output is negative. As
there is a linear relationship between the deviation of the frequency and the output
voltage, we get a faithful reproduction of the original audio signal.

RF Gain and Automatic Gain Control
If you want to receive a weak signal you turn up the RF gain. For ‘normal’ signals the gain
can be turned down which will also reduce the background noise level.
The strength of the signal is given by the S-meter. S-9 is a strong signal. +20 dB means
that it is even stronger by a factor of 100!
The automatic gain control, AGC, controls the gain of the RF and IF ampli ers so that the
output volume stays constant for weak and strong signals. It also helps with fading
propagation. The AGC circuit controls the gain of the ampli ers by either increasing or
decreasing the bias on the transistors. There is the option of either a quick or a slow
response to volume changes. You might want slow changes for voice but fast for CW and
data. A fast response would prevent a sudden change in volume a ecting your hearing.
The speed of the AGC response can be adjusted for the attack time, which refers to
increases in signal strength, as either quick or slow. Similarly, the speed of the AGC

response can be quick or slow for the decay time which refers to decreases in signal
strength.

Transceivers
Most radios combine reception and transmission in the form of a transceiver. They
normally share oscillators between the transmit and receive circuits. Similarly, they use
common IF lters to limit the bandwidth. A change-over circuit is employed to allow the
transceiver to either transmit or receive. When the circuit is not active, a signal from the
antenna bypasses the input circuits. When the push to talk microphone, PTT, is switched
on, the change-over circuit becomes active and the output circuits are activated.

Receiver Incremental Tuning, RIT
QRM cannot be helped sometimes when another station is operating near your
frequency. The receiver incremental tuning control, RIT, can help by shifting the receive
frequency without changing the transmit frequency. Another situation would be if you are
in a net and the other stations are transmitting on slightly di erent frequencies. Rather
than changing the frequency dial each time, you can use the RIT control.

Intermediate Frequency ampli ers
The intermediate frequency ampli er ampli es the output of the mixer before it is
demodulated. Thanks to the single fairly low frequency, the ampli er can be designed to
have high gain and stability. Most the gain of a superhet is provided by the IF ampli er.
The selectivity of the IF ampli er is achieved by an IF transformer. This consists of two LC
tuned circuits with the coils wound on a plastic bobbin. The whole package is tted in a
screening can. The coupling of the transformer coils governs the response of the tuning.
As the coils become closer, the response improves and the Q factor increases. However
an over-coupled response has a dip in the curve. The critical response curve has steep
sides too, but no dip.

Converters
A transverter enables a transceiver to be used on another band. For example the 144 to
146 MHz band can be received by the transverter, converted to 28 to 30 MHz by mixing it
with a local oscillator at 116 MHz. The transverter generally requires low power so the HF
transceiver must be used on lower power too. Also you need to be careful not to transmit
out of band.
When mixing two frequencies, we get the sum and di erence. In this case we are using
the sum. If we use the di erence frequency, we have to be aware that increasing the
frequency on the transmitter decreases the output frequency. For example, if we used a
local oscillator at 80 MHz, the di erence frequency would be 52 to 50 MHz, the wrong
way round!

External RF preampli ers
Need more gain? Do you want to be able to receive distant weak stations. ML&S Martin
Lynch & Sons Ltd will gladly supply you with a preampli er, but is it worth it? (https://
www.hamradio.co.uk/dx-engineering-rpa-2-modular-receive-preampli ers-dxe-rpa-2pd-6487 )
The speci cation for the preampli er states that the gain is 16 dB over the entire
frequency range of 300 kHz to 35 MHz. The noise gure is 3.5 dB and the dynamic range
is 110 dB. Sounds pretty good!

External RF preampli ers do not always improve overall performance. It all depends on
the RF noise in your area. If you are in a rural area with a low noise oor it will be
bene cial. However if the noise is high, it will get ampli ed too.
Sensitivity
The sensitivity is given by the weakest discernible signal. The preampli er ampli es
signals but it also ampli es the RF noise, as well as contributing some noise itself.
Dynamic range
The dynamic range can be reduced. For example, a receiver has a dynamic range of 5 μV
(-123 dB) to 158 mV (-33 dB). This is a dynamic range of
-33 - - 123 = 90 dB
Using a preampli er of gain 10 dB, it improves the weakest discernible signal to 3 μV
(-127 dB) and the maximum is now -23 dB. At the receiver, the gain changes the values to
-33 dB and -117 dB. The dynamic range is now
-33 - - 117 = 84 dB.
Therefore the gain is 10 dB but we have lost 6 dB in the dynamic range.
Signal to noise ratio
Atmospheric and galactic noise will be picked up by the antenna (see chapter on
propagation). This noise tends to be much higher at HF than at VHF/UHF. The preampli er
noise can be as much as 3 dB.
Is it worth having an external preampli er if we have a receiver with low noise gure? We
can do a comparison for a poor receiver with a noise of 0.5 pW and a good receiver with
a noise gure of only 0.01 pW. Let the rf noise be 0.02 pW and the power of the signal is
3 pW.
Given that the signal to noise ratio, SNR, is de ned as
SNR = 10 log (power of signal/power of noise)
We have SNR poor receiver = 10 log (3/0.52) = 7.6 dB
For the good receiver SNR = 10 log (3/0.03) = 20 dB
Now we add an external preampli er with its own noise of 0.1 pW and a gain of 10 dB.
The signal is ampli ed to 30 pW as is the rf noise from 0.02 pW to 0.2 pW.
For the poor receiver the combined noise = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.8 pW
Therefore the SNR = 10 log (30/0.8) = 15.7 dB, an improvement from 7.6 dB!

For the good receiver the combined noise = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.01 = 0.31 pW
Therefore the SNR = 10 log (30/0.31) = 19.8 dB, which is slightly worse than 20 dB!

In conclusion, a preampli er can be useful if the background RF noise is low. It would be
useful at VHF/UHF where the RF noise is less.
It should be located as close as possible to the antenna, so that weak signals are
ampli ed before travelling through the coaxial cable where they would lose some
strength. Mast head ampli ers are used for TV reception.

Questions on Receivers
1. The ICOM IC-7610 boasts a dynamic range of 100dB. The noise oor is 10 microvolts

and the loudest undistorted signal without overload is 1 volt. Using the formula for
voltage, DNR = 20 log (max signal in volts/ minimum discernible signal) show that the
signal to noise ratio is indeed 100dB.
2. Given that the dynamic range of a receiver is the di erence between the minimum

discernible signal and the maximum signal without overload, what is the maximum signal
for the ICOM if the sensitivity is 1dB.
3. The ICOM IC-7610 (https://icomuk.co.uk/ les/icom/PDF/newsFile/
IC-7610_Technical_Report_Vol1.pdf) speci es a receive sensitivity of 0.15 μV with the
preampli er 1 on, with an SNR of 10 dB for SSB in the range 1.8 to 30 MHz. Is this better
or worse than the Kenwood, whose value was 0.2 μV? Is the larger value better?
4. When would you select a sharp lter on your receiver?
5. Would adding an attenuator help to improve the signal to noise ratio?

Answers
The formula for dynamic range is
DNR = 20 log (max signal in volts/ minimum discernible signal).
Therefore the DNR = 20 log (1v/ 10microvolts) = 20 log (100,000) = 20 x 5 =100 dB
Sensitivity = The maximum signal is 100 + 1 = 101dB.
3. The larger value is worse! The ICOM is more sensitive than the Kenwood.
4. You would select a sharp lter on your receiver to eliminate adjacent frequencies which

are interfering with your operating frequency.
5. Adding an attenuator would not help to improve the signal to noise ratio as it would

attenuate the signal as much as the noise.

Feeders and Antennas
We met the need for a balun at Foundation level. In this chapter we look at the di erent
types of baluns. We nd out how the speed of the signal through a feeder cable is
important in determining its length. We consider how the voltage and current oscillates in
a dipole. We need to know the impedances of di erent antennas so that we can match
them for the appropriate feeder line.
Questions on this topic are at the end of the next chapter on Setting Up a Radio Station.

Velocity Factor
If we compare a wave travelling along a transmission line with one in the vacuum of free
space, it is very similar to the behaviour of light. In the vacuum light travels at the speed
c, 300,000 km/s. When light enters glass it slows down to only 200,000 km/s. It changes
direction too as it refracts. Inside the glass the frequency of the light is unchanged but the
wavelength decreases. Radio waves behave in the same way.
As a 10 MHz signal travels through a transmission cable, the current and voltage oscillate
10 million times a second. The speed at which the energy travels will be less than the
speed of light by a factor depending on the dielectric material of the transmission line.
The velocity factor VF is de ned as:

VF = speed of signal in the transmission line/speed of signal in a vacuum, c
(Unfortunately this is the opposite to the formula used by optical engineers.)

For example, for a coaxial feeder with a solid polythene dielectric, the velocity factor is
approximately 0.67 or 2/3. This value arises from the formula for the velocity factor in
terms of the dielectric constant, ε.
VF = 1/ √ε
The dielectric constant for polythene is 2.3, so the velocity factor is 1/√2.3 = 0.66.
For example, what is the speed of a signal

Electrical length and physical length
The electrical length is measured in wavelengths, such as /2. This is di erent to the
physical length measured in metres, where we take into account the velocity factor of the
signal. For example, a signal of frequency 10 MHz in a coaxial cable, the physical length
for one wavelength is
= VF x (3 x108)/ (10 x 106)
= 2/3 x 30 = 20 m
The physical length of 20 m is quite di erent to the electrical length , which is 30 m.
However open wire lines with just air insulation have a VF closer to 1, about 0.93 to 0.97.
therefore the physical length is nearer to the electrical length.
In the next chapter we will meet the quarter wave feeder which is used to match
impedances. For example, what would be electrical length and the physical length of a
quarter wave feeder for 14.3 MHz?
The wavelength in free space is given by 300/14.3 = 20.98 m. Therefore the electrical
length is /4, which is 20.98/4 m or 5.24 m. If the feeder is normal coax with a velocity
factor of 0.67 or 2/3, then the physical length is

= VF x 5.24 = 3.5 m

Baluns
The dipole antenna is a balanced antenna and should be fed with balanced 50Ω twin
cable, where the voltages and currents cancel each other. If you were to feed a dipole
with coaxial feeder cable, the cable could radiate as currents ow in the outer braid. Also,
it could pick up unwanted stray signals. You need a balance-unbalance transformer,
called a balun, between the end of the coaxial feeder and antenna.
Transformer balun
A transformer balun consists of two separate windings usually on a ferrite core. The core
must be able to cope with the frequencies and power levels. The unbalanced coax is
connected to ground via one of the windings. The other winding has its centre grounded,
providing the balanced outputs above and below the ground point.
The transformer balun can also be used to match impedances by changing the ratio of
the number of turns for the primary Np and the secondary Ns.

(Np/Ns)2 = Zp/Zs
A 1:1 balun has no impedance change as the number of turns are the same on the
primary and secondary. A 4:1 balun has twice the number of turns on the secondary
because the impedance is proportional to the square of the turns ratio.
Choke balun
A choke balun has several ferrite rings on the feeder. This prevents signals from travelling

on the outside of the braid.

fl

113
Sleeve balun
A sleeve balun has an extra braid on the outside the coaxial cable. It is only a short length
equal to a quarter of the wavelength of the frequency band in use, and is soldered to the
internal braid of the coax.

End correction factor
A half wave dipole need to take into account the velocity factor of the signal in the
antenna. Also any nearby conductors and securing points shorten the resonant length of
the antenna. All these factors contribute to the end correction factor. Typically, they
amount to 5%, so that the antenna length should be cut to about 95% of the length in
free space. For example, for 14 MHz the free space /2 = 10.7 m. Therefore it is reduced
by 0.95 to about 10.2 or 10 m.

Current and Voltage oscillations
When an antenna receives a radio wave whose frequency matches the natural frequency
of the antenna, resonance takes place. The length of the antenna needs to be half a
wavelength. Resonance means we get the biggest oscillation of the electrons in the
antenna. The electrons absorb the energy of the wave by electromagnetic induction and
oscillate at the same frequency of the radio wave. The electrons don’t all oscillate with the
same amplitude. The biggest amplitude is at the centre of the antenna. In fact, there is no
movement of the electrons at the ends of the antenna. The current is zero at the ends.
The electrons go in one direction, stop, and then go in the other direction. Over one cycle,
the current looks like this:

Let’s say you are picking up a signal from Australia with a peak power of 292 pW. We
know the radiation resistance of the antenna is 73 Ω. Using the formula for power, we
calculate the peak voltage to be 146 μV. What is the peak current? Using Ohm’s law, it is
2 μA.
It is very similar to the oscillation of air molecules in a column or tube of air. If you hold a
tuning fork over a column of air, of length equal to a quarter of the wavelength of the
sound, you will hear a loud sound. The air is resonating. At the open end, we have
maximum movement of the air, an anti-node, while at the closed end there is no
movement, a node.

We learnt at Foundation level that oscillations produce waves. If we cause the electrons in
the antenna to oscillate 50 million times a second then a radio wave of 50 MHz is emitted.
If the transmitter produces 100 W of power in the antenna itself, knowing the radiation
resistance is 73 Ω, we can calculate the current and voltage in the antenna. The graphs of
current and voltage will be the same as above. 100 W of radiant energy will travel into
space.

Feed point impedances
You need to be able to recall the feed point impedances of centre fed half-wave dipoles,
quarter-wave and loaded 5/8 verticals, folded dipoles, full-wave loops and end feed /4
and /2 antennas. How will you be able to learn all that?!
In the Intermediate manual the term radiation resistance for an antenna, fed at its centre
point, was introduced. When a /2 dipole is resonant, its impedance is resistive only with
a value of 73 Ω. This value is obtained by applying Maxwell’s laws to the electric and
magnetic elds radiated by the antenna.
A quarter wave /4 vertical will have half that impedance, 73/2 = 36.5 Ω
A loaded 5/8 vertical has a feed impedance between the two, 50 Ω. This is achieved by
using the inductor coil in the antenna.

A folded dipole has an impedance four times that of a basic dipole, 73 x 4 = 292 Ω. This
dipole can be fed with 300 Ω twin feeder.
An end fed /2 antenna will have a high impedance. Why? The impedance value of 73 Ω
is valid at the centre of the half wave. The impedance will increase as the feed point is
moved away from the centre to a maximum value at the end. On the other hand, a /4
end fed antenna will have a low value.
A full-wave loop antenna, such as a quad antenna, has a feed point impedance of 100 Ω,
which drops to 75 Ω with a re ector.

Folded dipoles in Yagi antennas
A Yagi antenna is simply a driven half-wave dipole with the added re ector and directors.
The e ect of these passive, as opposed to driven, antenna elements is to reduce the feed
point impedance. To bring the impedance back up to about 70 Ω the dipole is folded, but
it still has the same electrical length of /2.

Setting up a radio station
We have seen how an SWR meter is used to measure the SWR in a transmission line so
that we can then match it to an antenna.
For the Full Licence, we learn how to calculate the SWR. You would have thought that
with all the fuss about matching impedances, to the extent of including an image of a
foetus in the Foundation manual, that impedance would be in the formula for SWR. It is,
but the speci cation gives it in terms of voltages.
Typical Antenna Matching Units and Impedance Transformers are discussed.
There are no activities in this chapter as it is assumed you have used an AMU already.

Standing Wave Ratio, SWR
Voltages
Because we are talking about voltages, I will use the term Voltage Standing Wave Ratio,
VSWR.
We consider a lossless transmission line of impedance Zo = 75 Ω which is terminated by
a load impedance of ZL = 350 Ω. An incident wave from the transmitter travels to the right
of amplitude Vf = 1.0 v. It is re ected at the antenna load to produce a wave travelling to
the left of amplitude Vr = 0.65 v. The waves interfere to produce a stationary wave. 65%
of the voltage has been re ected which is not good!
Diagram page 145
The graph shows the stationary wave at an instant in time. For constructive interference,
the nal voltage = Vmax = Vf + Vr = 1.0 + 0.65 = 1.65 v. For destructive interference, the
nal voltage Vmin = Vf - Vr = 1.0 - 0.65 = 0.35 v.
The de nition of VSWR is given by

VSWR = (Vf + Vr) / ( Vf - Vr) = Vmax/Vmin
In this example VSWR = 1.65/ 0.35 = 4.7:1.
What if there is a perfect match, with no re ection. In that case, Vr = 0. Therefore Vmax =
Vmin, so that the VSWR = Vmax/Vmin = 1:1.
An alternative expression can be used by dividing the top and bottom by Vf. This leads to
the formula

VSWR = (1 + Vr/Vf)/(1- Vr/Vf)

Some more examples
Impedances
It is no wonder that the VSWR of 4.7:1 in the example was so bad. The termination load
was 350 Ω. In terms of impedances, the VSWR is given by
VSWR = ZL/Zo
if ZL>Zo
Or
VSWR = Zo/ZL
if ZL<Zo
Therefore the VSWR = 350/75 = 4.7:1
What if there is a perfect match, with ZL = Zo? In that case VSWR = ZL/Zo = 1:1
Some more examples
Power
SWR meters measure the forward and re ected power to provide a value for the SWR.
SWR is a more generic term than VSWR, which should be strictly applied to the voltage
standing waves. There are not power standing waves.
The formula for SWR in terms of power is not in the speci cation. It is given here for the
sake of completeness. The incident forward power is Pf, while re ected power is Pr.

SWR = (1 + √(Pr/Pf))/ (1 - √(Pr/Pf))
For example, if 50% of the incident power is re ected, what is the SWR?
Pr/Pf = 0.5
SWR = (1 + √0.5)/(1 - √0.5) which is about 6:1
Because power is proportional to voltage squared, voltage is proportional to the square
root of power. Therefore the ratio Vf/Vr would be proportional to the square root of 0.5.
The formula above could have been used to nd the VSWR.
VSWR = (1 + Vr/Vf)/(1- Vr/Vf) = (1 + √0.5)/(1 - √0.5)

Return Loss
To evaluate your transmission line you need to consider the incident and re ected power.
This gives rise to a rather counter intuitive term called return loss, RL. It is a measure of
how much power goes to the antenna to be radiated and not return to the transmitter. The
higher the value of the return loss, the better is your transmission line and the VSWR. It is
de ned as

return loss = 10 log (incident power/re ected power) measured in dB.
What if there is a perfect match and absolutely no power is re ected. The VSWR is 1:1, so
what is the return loss? In the formula, the denominator is zero, but dividing by zero gives
in nity! Therefore the return loss is in nite. Excellent!
At the other extreme, with all the power re ected, the re ected power = the incident
power, so the ratio is unity. The log of 1 is zero, so the return loss is 0 dB, very bad.
So a low VSWR equates to a high return loss, while a low return loss means a high
VSWR.

what it means
100% of the power is re ected
80% re ected
1% re ected, 99%

For example, 10% of the incident power is re ected, 90% goes to the antenna. What is
the return loss? The incident power is 100%.
Return loss = 10 log (100/10) = 10 log 10 = 10 x1 = 10 dB.
Another example. 100 W is sent by a transmitter to an antenna. 75W goes to the antenna
and 25 W returns to the transmitter. What is the VSWR and Return loss?
Return loss = 10 log (100/25) = 10 log 4 = 6 dB
The VSWR is in terms of voltages but we have been given the powers. We need to take
the square root of the power to obtain the voltage, because power is proportional to
voltage squared, so voltage is proportional to the square of the power.
VSWR = (1 + √0.25)/(1 - √0.25) = 3:1
This is not required for the examination, but the formula for return loss can be derived
from the re ection coe cient = Vr/Vf, which is related to the VSWR by
= (VSWR - 1)(VSWR + 1)
Return loss = 20 log

, where we use 20 because we are dealing with voltages.

Feeder loss masking e ect
We have performed calculations for the return loss at the antenna. We have assumed zero
loss in the feeder cable, which is not the case in real life. These gures are taken for Fzero very low loss coax cable available from Moonraker (https://moonrakeronline.com/fzero-coax-cable-new-formula-zero-high-performance-very-low-loss-coax-cable-per-metre):
10 MHz 0.78 dB per 100 m
50 MHz 2.92 dB
100 MHz 4.5 dB
1000 MHz 16.71 dB.
We need to add on losses due to any jumper cables and connectors.
If we measure the VSWR at the transmitter, what will it be at the antenna?
As the signal will travel along the cable, it gets re ected and returns back along the cable,
so we need to multiply any feeder cable loss by two.
The return loss at the transmitter will be the antenna loss plus twice the feeder cable loss.

return loss at transmitter = return loss at antenna + 2 x feeder loss.
Therefore you can be deceived into thinking your system is brilliant with a low VSWR
when in fact it could require immediate attention! The return loss result will be higher than
the return loss at the antenna by twice the feeder loss. As we saw earlier, a high return
loss means a low VSWR.
For example, you measure the VSWR at the transmitter and it gives a value of 1.2:1.
Sounds good, but is it? A VSWR of 1.2:1 converts to a return loss of 20.83 dB.
(The calculation is using

= (VSWR - 1)(VSWR + 1), and Return loss = 20 log

, which is

beyond the speci cation)
If you are transmitting at around 100 MHz and using 20 m of cable, the feeder loss will be
4.5 dB x 20/100, which is 0.9 dB.

return loss at antenna = return loss at transmitter - (2 x 0.9) dB
= 20.83 - 1.8 = 19 dB
Converting this to VSWR gives about 1.25. Acceptable. An SWR of 1.2:1 at the
transmitter and 1.25:1 at the antenna.
But what if the VSWR at the transmitter is 1.5:1, on the limit. The return loss = 13.8 - 1.8 =
12 dB, which converts to an SWR of 1.67:1. Not acceptable!
With a loss of 16.71 dB per 100m you can’t go using 100 m of cable at 1000 MHz! We
met Phil G0JBA when talking about frequency stability. Phil enjoys microwave
transmitting and above 2320 MHz he relies on return loss to check his system
performance. He tries to limit the length to 5 m, which would be a total cable loss of 1.67
dB. At 1296MHz, the 23cm Amateur Band, the losses in the cable are typically 3 dB of
loss for 10m of cable. This equates to a 10 W Transmitter having only 5 W of power
reaching the antenna. This also means that half of the receive signal is lost in the cable
which will greatly reduce the range that will be achievable. For 2320MHz, the 13cm band,
a 10m length of RG213 coaxial cable has a 4.2 dB loss!

Antenna Matching Units
If all is well and the impedances of the transmitter, feed line and antenna are all the same
at 50 Ω, the system is matched. This means all the power is transmitted, none is
re ected. It there is a mis-match, power will be re ected and the SWR readings could be
greater than 2:1. Not good!
To improve matters an Antenna Matching Unit, AMU, is inserted between the transmitter
and feed line. Ideally the AMU should be placed before the antenna but this is not always
practical.

The AMU is adjusted so that the impedance of the transmitter matches that of the feed
line. Placing the AMU at the end of the feed line, ensures that the feed line is matched to
the antenna. Inside the AMU are variable capacitors and inductors which cancel any
capacitive or inductive reactance in the feeder input. This leaves a resistive value, usually
50 Ω. How do you know when this has been achieved? The SWR reading on the AMU will
be the indicator. However creating a match between the transmitter and feed line does
not guarantee a match between the feed line and antenna. For example, if the SWR in the
feed line is 4:1, it will still be 4:1 even when the AMU presents the load to the transmitter
as 50 Ω.
You need to be able to identify the three main circuits for an AMU. - T, π and an inverted
L. They are shown in the diagrams on page 142 and can be recognised by their shapes.

Quarter Wavelength /4 Impedance Transformer.
A quarter wavelength impedance transformer is simply a short length of transmission line
used to match a feeder to an antenna instead of using an AMU. Its electrical length is
equal to a quarter of the wavelength.
Zo is the characteristic impedance of the line required to do the matching,
ZL is the impedance of the load or antenna, Zin is the impedance of the feeder.

Zin/Zo = Zo/ZL
Which becomes Zo = √(Zin ZL)
For example, what is the transmission line impedance required to match a load of 100Ω
to a feed line of 50Ω? If it is designed for 70 MHz, what is its electrical length and physical
length?
ZL = 100 Ω Zin = 50 Ω Zo = ?
Zo = √Zin ZL = √50 x 100 = √5000 = 70 .7 Ω
The wavelength of the signal is 300/70 = 4.28 m
The electrical length of the transformer = /4
As it is made from coax with a VF of 2/3,
The physical length = VF x 4.28/4 = 2/3 x 1.07 = 0.71 m
Stacking Yagi antennas
Yagi antennas are stacked to achieve greater gain. For example, 4 Yagi antennas for use
on 144 MHz have a combined impedance of 4 x 50 = 200 Ω. If the feeder is 50 Ω, then
the characteristic impedance of the transformer, called a matching tail, is given by
Zo = √50 x200 = √10000 = 100 Ω
The wavelength of the signal in free space is 300/144 = 2.08 m
As it is made from coax with a VF of 2/3,
The wavelength of the signal in the coax is = 2.08 x 2/3 m = 1.38 m
The electrical length of the transformer = /4
The physical length = 1.38/4 = 0.35 m

Home brewers would quite happily make their own coaxial transformer. As the
characteristic impedance is known, they can calculate the required dimensions.
Microwave microstrips
A microwave microstrip consists of a conductor on a dielectric layer, called a substrate,
which itself is on a ground plane.
For example, what is the required impedance for a microstrip impedance transformer to
match 300 Ω to 50 Ω at a frequency of 10 GHz. Assume the VF for the microstrip is 0.6.
Zo = √50 x300 = √15000 = 122.5 Ω
The wavelength of the signal in free space is 300/10,000 = 0.03 m = 3 cm

As it is made from microstrip with a VF of 0.6,
The wavelength of the signal in the microstrip is = 0.6 x 3 = 1.8 cm
The electrical length of the transformer = /4
The physical length = 1.8/4 = 0.45 cm = 4.5 mm

Feeders and Antennas Answers
1. The velocity factor of a coaxial feeder with a solid polythene dielectric is 0.67 or 2/3.
2. This means that the velocity of the signal through the cable is 2/3 of the speed of light.
The speed = 2/3 x 3 x 108 = 2 x 108 m/s.
3. The maximum voltage = 10 + 6 = 16 volts, while the minimum = 10 - 6 = 4 volts.
Therefore the VSWR = Vmax/Vmin = 16/4 = 4:1.
4. Using impedances, the VSWR = ZL/Zo = 200/50 = 4:1.
5. The maximum voltage = 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 volts, while the minimum = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95
volts.
Therefore the VSWR = Vmax/Vmin = 1.05/0.95 = 1.1:1.
6. The ratio of the impedances must also be 1.1:1, so ZL/Zo = 1.1
Zo = 50 Ω, so ZL = 50 x 1.1 = 55 Ω.
7. SWR = (1 + √(Pr/Pf))/ (1 - √(Pr/Pf)) where Pr = 0.01 and Pf = 0.99
SWR = (1 + √(0.01/0.99))/(1- √(0.01/0.99)) = 1.22
8. The VSWR is given by ZL/Zo = ZL/50. If you are prepared to accept 1.5:1, then
1.5 = ZL/50 so that ZL = 1.5 x 50 = 75 Ω
The antenna impedance would now be 75 Ω instead of 50 Ω.
9. Return loss = 10 log (incident power/re ected power) measured in dB. Incident power
= 100% while re ected power = 1%. Therefore return loss = 10 log (100/1) = 10 x 2 = 20
dB.
10. Using Moonraker’s gures for 50 MHz cable, and a run of 50 m,
the total cable loss = 2 x (2.92 x 50/100) = 2.92 dB
Therefore the return loss at the transmitter = 25 + 2.92 = 27.92 dB.
11. The characteristic impedance of 6 stacked Yagi antennas would be 6 x 50 = 300 Ω.
12. The impedance transformer would require an impedance Zo = √(Zin ZL) = √50 x 300 =
√15000 = 122.5 Ω
13. The characteristic impedance of 8 stacked Yagi antennas would be 8 x 50 = 400 Ω.
14. The impedance transformer would require an impedance Zo = √(Zin ZL) = √50 x 400 =
√20000 = 141.4 Ω
15. The wavelength of the signal in free space is 300/2320 = 0.13 m = 13 cm
As it is made from microstrip with a VF of 0.6,
The wavelength of the signal in the microstrip is = 0.6 x 13 = 7.8 cm
The electrical length of the transformer = /4
The physical length = 7.8/4 = 1.95 cm = 19.5 mm
16. The polarisation of a quarter wave vertical antenna, at its resonant frequency using
the earth as a ground plane, would be vertical and its feed impedance would be low.
17. The value of the impedance transformer to match a 400 Ω line with a 100 Ω line is
given Zo = √(400 x 100 = √40000 = 200 Ω.
18. You would use a 1:1 transformer balun to match coaxial cable to a balanced antenna
such as a dipole.
19. You would use a 4:1 transformer balun to match coaxial cable to a balanced antenna
and to match impedances.
20. The feed point impedance of a quarter wave /4 vertical antenna is about 36 Ω.
21. The voltage at the end of a resonating dipole antenna will oscillate at the resonant
frequency with a maximum value, compared to the centre where it will be zero at all
times.
22. For 7 MHz, /2 = 300/7 x 1/2 = 21.4 m. Therefore the length should be 0.95 x 21.4 =
20.3 m.

Propagation
The propagation of radio waves was discussed in the chapter on radio waves, in terms of
the oscillations of the electric and magnetic elds. Here we consider the ionosphere
where harmful UV is absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere, separating electrons from
atoms. HF propagation is only possible because of the Sun’s radiation. We consider the
extreme e ects of the Sun’s activity, with solar ares and coronal mass ejections. Space
weather is important too with radio interference from our active galaxy, the Milky Way.
Also in this section we look at the indicators for good propagation that are available for
the amateur radio operator.

The Inverse Square Law
When you drop a stone in a pond, the ripples get smaller as the wave travels outwards.
The energy is spread over a wider and wider circle. We know the energy is getting weaker
as the wave goes out further because the amplitude of the wave is less. In the same way
the energy from an antenna or a light source gets weaker as the wave travels but this is
now in three dimensions. The electromagnetic energy from a source of waves spreads out
as a sphere. A faint star is further away than a bright star. The energy falling on a surface
will decrease as the distance from the source increases.
The energy of a wave depends on the square of the amplitude. For a sound wave the
amplitude is displacement of the air molecules. For a radio wave the amplitude is the
electric eld strength, so the energy depends on the square of the electric eld strength.
We saw in the chapter on Radio Waves that the power ux density is measured in W/m2.
The inverse square law tells us that if we double the distance, the power ux density is
reduced by a quarter. Treble the distance, it is nine times weaker. If we plot the power ux
density against distance, we can see the rapid change.

Graph of energy ux against distance.
The Inverse Square Law is applicable to all kinds of waves. The relevance of this law to
amateur radio is well done if your antenna can receive signals from the other side of the
planet. QRP operating is your battle against the inverse square law!

For example a signal has a power ux density of 10 W/m2 at a distance of 100 m. What is
the power ux density at a distance of 1 km? A ten times the distance, the power ux
density will be 100 times less. Therefore it will be 100 mW/m2.
For NASA, the challenge is to continue to receive signals from spacecraft such as
Voyager. According to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the transmitter on the Voyagers is
just strong enough to power an ordinary refrigerator light bulb. By the time the signals
reach Earth, they are one-tenth of a billionth trillionth of a watt, which is 10 to the minus
19. What is that dBW?!
How does the electric eld strength change with distance? Electric eld strength is
measured in volts per metre. It decreases with distance as an inverse relationship. This
means if we double the distance we halve the electric eld strength. For example, if the
electric eld strength is 8 V/m at a distance of 12 m what is its value at 6m? It will be
twice as much, 16 V/m.

You hear that the solar ux is up to 200 and the Kp is 3. Is that good news or bad news?
Sunspot number
In normal conditions a state of dynamic equilibrium exists, with the Sun causing ionisation
while the electrons recombine with the ions. The level of radiation from the Sun depends
on the number of sunspots, which are the slightly cooler regions of the Sun’s surface. The
sunspot number is the number of sunspots and sunspot groups on the Sun’s surface
facing the Earth. For example, the website spaceweather.com tells me that the number is
151. In 2019 there were 281 days with no sunspots at all, so 151 is signi cant. As the
number increases so does the amount of UV, causing more ionisation in the ionosphere.
This is good news as it improves propagation on the bands above 10 MHz, even at night,
raising the maximum useable frequency, MUF. However the lowest useable frequency,
LUF, is also increased, with the low frequency bands of 80 and 160 metres su ering from
more absorption. When the cycle is at a minimum, the reverse is true, with good
propagation for 80 and 160 metres, but not so good for 20 MHz.
Activity 10.1 track the sunspot number over a period of time
The Solar Flux Index, SFI, is another indicator of solar activity. It measures the amount of
ux emitted by the Sun at a frequency of 2800 MHz or 16.7 cm, and is measured in Solar
Flux Units or sfu. It can vary from 50 to 300. Today it is 186 sfu. If the value is low, the
MUF will be low. A high value means that there is enough ionisation to permit DX-ing at
higher than normal frequencies.
Activity 10.2 compare the SFI and MUF over a period of time
Solar ares
Occasionally, a solar are erupts from the Sun, releasing large amounts of energy with X
rays as well as UV. Travelling at the speed of light it reaches the Earth’s atmosphere 8
minutes later, increasing the ionisation. The are also disrupts the Earth’s protective
geomagnetic eld. A big solar are, called an X-class are, can cause radio blackout,
called a sudden ionospheric disturbance, SID. Sudden because it happens so quickly,
only 8 minutes from leaving the Sun. There will be a high degree of ionisation in the D
layer resulting in attenuation of radio frequencies. For the higher layers of the ionosphere
this can improve conditions for the higher frequency bands before black out occurs.
The measure of geomagnetic activity is the Kp index. Today it is 0.67, quiet. A Kp value of
4 would indicate a degradation of HF propagation while a value of 6 indicates a large
storm. A Kp value of 9 would mean a very major storm which would disrupt HF
communications as well as satellite communications.
So a solar ux of 200 sfu and a Kp of 4 show that the space weather is unsettled.
Activity 10.3 track the Kp value over a period of time
Coronal Mass Ejection
As well as emitting radiation, the Sun also emits charged particles, called the solar wind.
They interact with the Earth’s geomagnetic eld and can cause a geomagnetic storm. A
coronal mass ejection, CME, sends out a vast number of energetic particles. They can
take about 20 to 40 hours to reach Earth and we can sometimes see the e ect with the
Northern Lights, Aurora Borealis, visible at low latitudes.

Critical frequency of vertical incidence
The critical frequency is the highest frequency for which a signal will return to Earth when
it is transmitted straight up. This is measured with an ionosonde. The Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory operates ionosondes at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Chilton, as
shown in the photo, and at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.

It sends a signal upwards, it gets re ected by a region of the ionosphere and is received
back on the ground, rather like radar. To access the data, unfortunately you have to
register for the UK Solar System Data Centre. However the data from Dourbes in Belgium
is available. This is the Ionogram for the 13th February 2024.

You can see from the upward curve that the critical frequency is between 5 and 6 MHz.
Therefore the critical frequency gives a useful understanding of the condition of the

fl

127
ionosphere for the day. Also it enables forecasting of the Maximum Useable Frequency,
MUF, for several years ahead.
Another useful website is https://www.propquest.co.uk/graphs.php from the 80m Norfolk
Amateur Radio Club, who use propagation gures to help them with their local net.

Maximum Useable Frequency MUF
The Maximum Useable Frequency will be 3 to 4 times the critical frequency. It depends
on several factors:
- The time of day, with a peak between 10.00 and 16.00
- The sunspot number. It is much higher at the sunspot maximum than the minimum due
to the increased ionisation
- The season. It is much higher in the winter than the summer.
- The path. It depends on the skip distance.

Near Vertical Incidence Skywave, NVIS
How do you communicate with a station beyond the range of a ground wave, but in the
skip zone? You could attempt using NVIS. Frequencies below the critical frequency will
return to Earth, but higher frequency waves go o into space. Therefore you transmit at a

ff

fi

128
frequency below the critical frequency and adjust your antenna so that your signal go
upwards. It will re ect from the ionosphere and get scattered on its return to Earth.
The coverage can be hundreds of kilometres. This method works well for the low
frequency bands such as 5 MHz, as they are usually above the LUF and below the critical
frequency.

Cross Polarisation
Polarisation was discussed in the chapter on radio waves. At HF the ionosphere can
change the direction of polarisation of the wave. Therefore the orientation of your antenna
is not an issue at HF. You can use a vertical or a horizontal antenna, it doesn’t matter.
However, at VHF and UHF it does matter. Your receiving antenna should have the same
orientation as the polarisation of the transmitted signal. If you try to receive a horizontally
polarised wave with a vertically polarised antenna, the signal strength will be reduced as
much as 20 dB. This known as cross polarisation.

Earth Moon bounce
For Earth-Moon-Earth propagation, or moon bounce, all you need to do is to point your
antenna at the Moon so that your signal will bounce o , to be received elsewhere on
Earth. If only it were that easy!
There are several requirements as it is a huge challenge.
Both stations need to be able to see the Moon, ideally at its perigee when the Moon is
closest to the Earth and we get a Super moon. The distance is about 363,000 km.
The transmitter must be very powerful, as the Moon is so far away and its surface is a
poor re ector. It is hardly a smooth surface with so many craters, so only about 6% gets
re ected. Obviously a directional antenna with high gain is needed. Also it needs to be
steerable to track the Moon’s orbit.
Peter Weatherall G3MLO reckons the path loss is a massive 250 dB on 144 MHz and 270
dB on 1.296 GHz. You can see his set up in the photo, which is quite modest compared

to the photos of antennas on the QSL cards he receives from around the world, mostly
Japan and the USA.
Peter uses EA6VQ’s calendar (https://www.dxmaps.com/emecalendar.html) to nd the
best time to attempt a call. As he says, he enjoys a challenge!
CW is an obvious mode but digital modes can be used too, such as JT65, part of the
WSJT-X software package.
The RSGB has more details here (https://rsgb.org/main/technical/space-satellites/
moonbounce/) about further challenges due to the Doppler e ect.

Activity 10.4 Find out where the nearest EME activity is taking place and have a go!

Auroral propagation
An aurora, also know as the Northern Lights or Southern Lights (Aurora Borealis or Aurora
Australis) occurs after a coronal mass ejection. The solar wind produces a lot of ionisation

and a colourful light show at high north and south latitudes, as the charged particles
collide with oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the E layer.
For the radio amateur, the aurora creates an auroral curtain of ions which can re ect
signals on the VHF bands.
The signals should be directed north towards the aurora so that they bounce o the
curtain. As the curtain is constantly changing and is not static, the movement causes the
signal to be distorted and utter rapidly. CW and digital modes are the best to use but the
CW signals have a buzzing sound.

Hilderstone Radio Society member Andrew G0MBL told me he gave auroral propagation
a try on 2 metres and he was able to work Scotland, Norway, Sweden and Finland, using
10 W on SSB and a small 6 element ZL Yagi. He said the sound of the signal is very hard
to describe, but once heard it is never forgotten!

Activity 10.5 Listen to auroral propagation.

Galactic Noise

Our radio signals travel out into space. Space sends radio waves to Earth. The
waves have a range of frequencies and contribute to a random noise level which
can be heard in a radio receiver. Their origin is electrical activity in the cosmos. The
galactic, or cosmic noise, increases when the antenna is directed at the Sun,
Jupiter or the Milky Way.

Link Budget
When designing a communication link between two sites, there are many factors to
consider. Link budget analysis takes into account all the gains and losses in the link. The
propagation path length and its loss, the transmitter power, feeder losses and antenna
gain are all considered. Knowing the transmitted power the strength of the received signal
can be calculated. The path loss includes the weakening of the signal as it travels or
spreads, as well as any losses due to obstructions such as buildings and hills.
There is an app that can calculate the link budget available here (https://
www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/link-budget-analysis.html) and a formula in this
website (https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/propagationoverview/radio-link-budget-formula-calculator.php)
The calculation can be done using dB. For example, a transmitter produces a power of 20
dB into an antenna of gain 6 dB, However there is a feeder loss of 2 dB and a path loss of
- 50 dB. At the receiver, the feeder loss is also 2 dB but the antenna gain is 10 dB. What
is the received power in dB?
Answer = 20 + 6 - 2 - 50 - 2 +10 = -18 dB
What if the power of the transmitter is given in watts and not dB? For example, 10 W. You
have to convert the watts in dBm, which for 10 W is 40 dBm. The link budget analysis will
give a result in dBm, which you can compare with the sensitivity of the receiver. For the
Kenwood TS-890s it is 0.2 μV, which is -121 dBm.
There are more examples of path loss in the chapter on measurements and decibels.

Answers
1. The directions of the electric eld, the magnetic eld and the direction of travel are at
right angles to each other.
2. Up to 2 MHz the major method of propagation is by ground waves.
3. The skip zone is the region from the point at which the ground wave cannot teach to
where the re ected wave has returned to Earth.
4. Long distance communication on the 40 to 160 metre bands more di cult during the
day because the D layer absorbs these signals.
5. The F2 layer is the main contributor to long distance communication because it is the
highest.
6. The F2 layer would be at the greatest height where the Sun is overhead.
7. When the LUF is greater than the MUF no propagation can take place by sky wave.
8. The F2 layer can provide one hop of about 4000 km.
9. Radio waves whose frequency is less than the LUF are completely absorbed.
10. Radio waves whose frequency is greater than the LUF but less than the MUF return to
Earth.
11. Knowing the MUF for the day you should operate on a frequency just below it.
12. The factors that a ect the MUF are the path, the time of day, the season and solar
radiation.
13. An alternative method to see if propagation is possible is to check with international
beacons.
14. NVIS propagation is short distance propagation using high angles of elevation.
15. A rising Kp index indicates that there will be increasing disruption of the geomagnetic
eld.
16. An X-class are is bad news for radio propagation as it could disrupt radio
communications.
17. Your radio would indicate that a solar are has been received by a rise in the radio
background noise.
18. The mode preferable for moonbounce would be JT65 because it can decode signals
with a very low signal to noise ratio.
19. The best time in the Moon’s orbit to attempt EME propagation is when the Moon is at
its closest distance, at its perigee, so that the path loss is least.
20 Two advantages of NVIS propagation are that it enables contacts beyond the ground
wave distance and it can overcome obstacles such as hills.
21. The aurora or Northern Lights is caused by charged particles from the Sun interacting
with the Earth’s magnetic eld and colliding with molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere.
22. The mode preferable for auroral propagation would be CW because the utter would
not concern an experienced user. For other users, a digital mode would be suitable.
23. According to the inverse square law, the power ux density will be 20 x 20 less.
Therefore it is 1/400 W/m2 or 2.5 mW/m2.
24. The season with the highest MUF is winter, and during the day compared to night.
25. The lowest is lowest useable frequency and the highest is the maximum useable
frequency.

Operating
Split TX and RX
You might hear a station having a QSO but you cannot hear the other station. This could
be because the station has a unique call sign and is experiencing a pile up. The station is
transmitting on one frequency and receiving on another. The rare station has said
‘listening 5 up’, meaning 5 kHz higher on the band. If you want to contact the station do
not transmit on their transmit frequency!
Alternatively they could be operating on two di erent bands. The bene t would be to
have a normal conversation in that both could talk at the same time!

Special events
These are organised to celebrate a special event such as British Science week or a club
anniversary. You can ask Ofcom for a special call sign, such as GBXBSW, where X is a
number. You must be present at the event to supervise it, unless it is under a club call
sign so that any fully licensed member can supervise. You must open it to the public
which is the whole point of the exercise, to advertise the hobby of amateur radio.
Activity 12.1 organise a special event station

5 MHz and 472 kHz
You must be careful not to infringe on the primary user, the MOD, so you need to stay
within the sub-band slots.

Band Plans
Band plans in other countries and IARU regions may not align with the UK plans. This
means you must respect their band plans and not expect an overseas friend to operate
on a frequency which is not allowed in their country. Similarly, you must stay within the
UK band plans. For example, a friend in the US might ask you to operate on a frequency
allowed in their country but not yours.

These are some of the documents you need to read.
Ofcom has explained the new licence rules in this document, Amateur Radio Guidance

Your Licence
When you get your Full Amateur Radio Licence, what does this licence permit you to do? It
permits you to learn about radio communications, by using your radio equipment to
transmit to and receive from other radio stations. It does not permit you to use it for
business use or commercial advertising. You can’t sell stuff, like on eBay.

Regional Secondary Locators RSL
You can use your radio anywhere in the UK, but you can change your call sign to indicate
where you are operating from, if you wish, meaning it is optional. If you live in Scotland
your call sign would be MM7ABC, with the Regional Secondary Locator equal to M for
Scotland, but if you operate in England it is omitted to give M0ABC. However if you wish,
you can add an E to become ME0ABC
For Northern Ireland, it changes to MI0ABC.
For the Isle of Man, to MD0ABC.
For Wales, to MW0ABC.
For Jersey, to MJ0ABC.
For Guernsey, to MU0ABC.
The same is true for full licence holders, whose call sign would be MM0ABC in Scotland,
changing to M0ABC in England or ME0ABC.
However!
Intermediate licence holders with a ‘2’ format must use a regional secondary locator, to
con rm with the Radio Regulations. in England we have E added, to give 2E0ABC. For
example, if you were in Scotland your call sign would be 2M0ABC, which would change to
2E0ABC in England. In time, they will change to M8 and M9 call signs.

fi

135

Suf xes
You can add a suf x, but it is not compulsory. You can add /A, /P and /M.
/A means alternative, if you are at a location which has a post code, such as a friend’s
house,
/P, portable, if you are somewhere without a post code, such as camping in a eld,
/M, mobile if you are on the move, such as in a car or walking, or airborne.
So you would say ‘my call sign is M0ABC stroke mobile.
/MM, maritime mobile, which is for licence holders out at sea
You can indicate where you are by adding something helpful such as M0ABC/Beach!
However Ofcom is quite strict in your use of a suf x because it becomes a ‘core’ call sign.
You need to be aware that an inappropriate suf x would contravene the Wireless
Telegraphy (Content of Transmission) Regulations, 1988 and it would become a police
matter.
If you are airborne the aircraft must be registered in the United Kingdom, the Channel
Islands or the Isle of Man. Also you are restricted to 500 mW EIRP in primary amateur
radio bands only. (Schedule 1, page 15, Table C).
Similarly you can operate from a ship but it is limited to ships registered in the United
Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, in international waters. It goes without
saying that you have sought permission from the captain of the vessel or aircraft
beforehand.
This sounds very tempting, to take your radio on a cruise or on a ferry across the channel.
However, if your cruise is from Dover on one of Fred’s ships, you will nd they are
registered in the Bahamas. P&O Ferries? Cyprus and the Bahamas. In those cases, you
would need to get authorisation from the administration of the country of registration for
the ship or aircraft, bearing in mind that some countries do not allow airborne amateur
radio use.

Station Identi cation
You must give your call sign when you change frequency and when you change mode on
the radio. The mode button is used to change to Frequency Modulation, Amplitude
Modulation, Single Sideband, Continuous Wave (Morse Code) or a DATA mode, such as
PSK, RTTY, WSPR and FT8.
Also you need to give your call sign if there is a change in supervisor, and if you change
your regional locator.

General Reception
When you make a CQ call you are not addressing any particular individual. This is one
occasion when you make a general reception message. The main intention is to
communicate with another licensee. When you are in a net of several amateurs, it is ne to
say something for the general reception of the group, such as ‘bye everyone!’ This is
allowed because you have identi ed yourself at the beginning of the net.
You must give your unique call sign as a means of identi cation.
Another exception to general reception is for a Beacon or a Data Station which would
automatically transmit a call sign.

Any change?
If you change your name, address or mailing address, you must notify Ofcom immediately.
You need to re-validate your licence every ve years by logging on to the Ofcom website.
If you fail to do so, or breach your licence conditions, Ofcom can revoke your licence. A
good suggestion is to re-validate on the 29th February. While it is every 4 years, at least it
is a date you can remember!

No secret codes!
It’s OK to send Morse code, but you are not allowed to send any secret codes, ‘except
under very speci c circumstances’. Encrypted messages can be sent if you are supporting
a User Service. Control signals between an earth command station and an amateur
satellite are allowed.

Ofcom’s powers
Ofcom can instruct you to provide access to, modify or shut down your radio equipment, if
your equipment was causing interference to another user. They may request that you
modify your equipment and change the way it transmits so that it no longer causes
interference.
A person authorised by Ofcom has the right to inspect your Radio Equipment. They can
require you to modify it by turning down the power, for example. They can even close you
down or restrict your use of it. They could require you to keep a log of your operating, if
they think you are causing interference.

Your Radio Equipment
Your licence will mention your radio equipment as the equipment which you use in your
home. If you are visited by a UK licensed amateur friend, he or she can use your
equipment. In fact, anyone can use your equipment provided you have given permission
and you are supervising them, so that you can take back control should you need to do so.
Your friend must be aware of the limitations of your licence. If your friend is licensed, they
can use your call sign, with the limitations of the Full Licence, or they can use their own,
adding /A if they wish.
You can allow your radio equipment to be used by a member of a User Service, such as
the Police or Emergency Services.
You should carry out tests from time to time, to ensure that your station is not causing
undue interference to other radio users. Your equipment needs to be stable so as not
cause unwanted emissions such as harmonics or operate outside the permitted
bandwidth. If you have made your own equipment you must ensure it is compliant with the
regulations document ‘Radio Equipment Regulations 2017’.
Your equipment is subject to Electromagnetic Field, EMF, restrictions and you need to
keep a written record of assessments carried out. We will explain this in more detail in the
Safety chapter.

Permitted Power levels
At Full level, you are permitted 1000 W 40 dBW PEP in the primary bands, 400 W 26 dBW
in most other bands.
It’s interesting to see why at Foundation the power is quoted as 25 W 13.98 dBW PEP.

fi

fi

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

137
The conversion is 10 log(25/1) = 10 x 1.39794 = 14 dBW to two signi cant gures. If you
want to quote to four signi cant gures, you need to be consistent. Working backwards,
the power is 25.00 W. Embarrassing!
If you operate above 10 W EIRP (6.1 W ERP) you need to have assessed your EMF
compliance.

Messages
You can only send messages to other amateurs.
You might arrange a ‘Net’ or ‘Network’ with your licensed friends but each person must
identify themselves with their call sign. When you make a CQ call, you are transmitting to
anybody who may be listening. That is the only time you are allowed to transmit generally.
You can’t transmit on the radio and say ‘hey, everybody, I passed my exam!’
In the situation of an international disaster messages may be passed, internationally, on
behalf of non-licensed persons. Non-amateur stations involved in international disaster
communications may also be heard on amateur frequencies.
Messages must not cause offence, according to legislation set up by the Wireless
Telegraphy (Content of Transmission) Regulations 1988 and the Communications Act
(2003).

Foreign recognition
The group that administers European licences is the European Conference of Postal and
Telecommunication Administrations or CEPT. Radio amateurs from CEPT countries are
permitted to operate during short visits, usually up to three months, in other CEPT
countries without obtaining an individual temporary licence from the visited CEPT country.
Your call sign is preceded by pre x for that country followed by /, stroke, such as 5B/
M0ABC for Cyprus, if your call sign is normally MM0ABC, dropping the RSL.

Unattended and remote control operation
Amateur Radio Direction Finding competitions are great fun, and they enable nonlicensed persons to use amateur radio equipment. You are now allowed to hide a
transmitter, a beacon, which will transmit its call sign every so often, for the competitors
to nd. The power of the transmitter must be no greater than 5 W ERP.
You need to ensure that the Radio Beacon does not cause undue interference. Ofcom
may request evidence that you have done this. If Ofcom wants you to close down the
Radio Beacon Station, you have two hours in which to do so.
Radio Beacons can be operated up to 25 W ERP provided it is identi ed with its allocated
call sign, which is published by the RSGB.
You can nd out about events and how to borrow equipment here https://rsgb.org/main/
about-us/committees/ardf-committee/
You can remotely control your radio. Why would you want to do that? There might be a lot
of RF noise in your area or you might live in a con ned spot. However, the Remote
Control link must be by radio in an amateur band, limited to 500 mW pep e.r.p. maximum
transmit power. It should be above 30 MHz. It must be failsafe, to avoid unintended
transmissions. Also, it must be adequately secure, to ensure the station remains
compliant with the terms of the Licence. Your remote control operation is for your use
only, and not for general use by other amateurs. Also the Licence Number must be
displayed on or next to the radio equipment.

Gateway, Repeater and Data Station operation
Your radio equipment can be used as a Gateway, a Repeater or a Data Station. It may be
operated by other radio amateurs without supervision. However the same restrictions
apply as for Radio Beacons. Repeaters are limited to frequency bands below 28 MHz.
Low power repeaters are limited to 5 W, and for only holders of an Intermediate or Full
Licence. Beyond 5 W to 25 W you need an NoV, a notice of variation.

Electromagnetic Compatibility, EMC
We will look at how interference can enter your radio and the electronic devices in your
home. We will examine the symptoms and how to recognise interference. Then we see
what to do about it and how to test for interference. A good station layout is important.
Finally we will look at vehicle interference and the social aspects of dealing with
interference. But rst of all we will look at some of the tragic consequences of
interference.

The dangers of Electromagnetic Interference, EMI.
The e ects of EMI can be devastating. An airline pilot was ying his 757 jet when all the
navigation displays showed bizarre readings. He was on his way to Baltimore but the
display showed he was miles o course. Suddenly everything returned to normal. It
turned out that a passenger was using a CD player and when it was on, all the navigation
displays went haywire!

The worst UK case was of HMS She eld (https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19960009442/
downloads/19960009442.pdf) The She eld had the most sophisticated antimissile defence
system of its day. However it caused electromagnetic interference to radio
communications with the Harrier jets assigned to the ship. When the Harriers took o and
landed, the missile defence was disengaged to allow communications with the pilots.
This provided a window of opportunity for the Exocet missile.
Hopefully your humble radio station will not cause any catastrophes. As part of your
armoury, you should have a variety of tools, such as ferrite components (clamps, beads,
toroidal), metal or fabric conductive tape, aluminium foil, gaskets, power line lters and
copper braid. Oh, and not forgetting an old AM radio.

Filtering
If you are receiving interference you could use clip-on ferrite rings attached to mains leads.
You can use a balanced antenna or even a directional antenna, pointing away from the
source of the noise.
The different kinds of lters were featured in the chapter on transmitters.
The simplest rst order lter uses either a capacitor or an inductor. The reactance of a
capacitor decreases as the frequency increases while the reactance of an inductor
increases as the frequency increases.

The second order lter uses a capacitor and an inductor, whose values depend not only on
the cutoff frequency but the impedance of the source and the load. This type of lter is
called an L type lter as we can see from its shape - an upturned letter L.
The third order lter uses a combination of capacitors and inductors. One kind is called a π
lter because it looks like a π, while the other is called a T lter - it looks like a T.

While it is easy to identify if a circuit is an L, π or T lter, how do we remember what
ltering they achieve - high, low, band pass or band stop? We don’t. We work it out. In the
chapter on DC circuits we explained how a coupling capacitor works by setting up a
potential difference across it. Here we use our knowledge of potential dividers and how the
reactance of a capacitor varies with frequency. Therefore in the rst L type diagram
(adapted from ‘Testing for EMC Compliance’ by M. Montrose and E. Nakauchi) for a low
pass lter, the capacitor has high reactance at low frequencies, so the output will be a high
voltage at low frequencies. The input voltage appears at the output unscathed! Therefore
the response is good at low frequencies. At a higher frequency the reactance of the
capacitor will be low, causing the output voltage to be low, so the response is worse,
increasing as the frequency increases.

Mains lter
‘Dirty electricity’ is how one manufacturer of mains lters describes noise getting into the
mains electricity. They can cost from £9000 to tens of pounds. The Schurter power line
lter costs £12 https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/power-line- lters/1105566?gb=s
Wurth Elektronik have a useful diagram on their website. https://www.we-online.com/en/
components/applicationguide/appguide_mains_ lter
This lter will suppress the common mode noise. 50 Hz will be able to pass but high
frequency noise will not.

Clicking on the + signs gives more information. For example, the + next to the choke
brings up the common mode power line chokes available. The capacitor is a special lm
capacitor with a high safety speci cation.

Coaxial stubs
A coaxial stub is simply a quarter wavelength piece of coax connected parallel to the
feeder. For example to suppress 2 m, the length would be about 50 cm, with allowance
made for the velocity factor. One end is open circuit while the other is short circuited.

Braid breaking lter
Suffering from interference on your TV? Simply loop the cable from the wall to the TV
round a ferrite ring, close to the TV. The high frequency TV signal will pass but low
frequencies, below 50 MHz, will be blocked. It is called braid breaking because an
alternative is to break the braid and insert a high pass lter. A high value resistor is
included to allow any static electricity to leak to ground.

Compliant and non-compliant equipment
Radio signals are increasing used for devices in the home, for wi- , bluetooth, the internet
of things. The EU directive https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/
electrical-and-electronic-engineering-industries-eei/electromagnetic-compatibility-emcdirective_en states that ‘it limits electromagnetic emissions from equipment to ensure
that, when used as intended, such equipment does not disturb radio and
telecommunication, as well as other equipment.’
Therefore look for the CE or in the case of goods in the GB market, the UKCA mark, a
requirement after 31 December 2024.
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/1091/contents
Imported devices and toys may not be compliant with the EU directive and not meet the
relevant EMC standards. You need to be aware that they could cause interference. Does
your construction project meet the required standards?
Cordless or mobile telephone, routers, baby alarms and computers may produce strong
interference signals when they are close to other devices. The same is true of home
construction projects. If there is a problem, simply moving the o ending item could solve
the problem.

Overload
Strong unwanted signals, such as from an FM station, can cause your receiver to no
longer perform linearly, with the result that the gain is reduced. In fact, a weak signal
could then fade and be completely attenuated. The strong signal could even be in a
di erent frequency band! The reduction in gain is called blocking or de-sensing. A radio’s
speci cation will mention its blocking dynamic range. For example, the ICOM-7700
‘employs three lters of 15 kHz, 6kHz and 3 kHz before the rst ampli er. As a result, the
3 kHz lter provides about 134 dB of blocking dynamic range and allows you to pull out a
weak signal while blocking strong adjacent signals’.
A strong unwanted signal, such as from an SSB or AM station, can even enter your
receiver and modulate the wanted signal! You would hear a varying signal, which is
following the modulation of the unwanted signal. This e ect is called cross-modulation.
Another e ect of strong signals is intermodulation. Signals from di erent transmitters, on
di erent frequencies, take advantage of the non-linearity and mix. We saw in the chapter
on receivers that mixers can produce sum and di erence frequencies. Also harmonics

can be produced, adding to the intermodulation products. For example, you are happily
listening on 145.5 MHz. However two nearby transmitters, which could be a TV channel
or a factory, are sending strong signals at 181.0 MHz and 35.5 MHz. These signals could
mix, giving a di erence frequency of 181.0 - 35.5 = 145.5 MHz! Intermodulation products
can be caused by corroded contacts in any metalworks, including the transmitting and
receiving antennas, supports and guttering. A corroded metal joint is very nonlinear,
allowing strong signals to mix in the joint and generate intermodulation products.
Remember intermodulation products could be (2 x f1) - f0, (2 x f0) - f1, and so on up to
the 4th and 5th harmonics.
To prevent overload and intermodulation products, a switchable attenuator is
incorporated in receivers. For example, the ICOM 7700 has a 4 step attenuator providing
6, 12 and 18 dB attenuation, and o .

Direct pick-up
Wiring such as long speaker leads or the internal wiring of a device can pick up RF
signals. It is possible for semiconductor or diode junctions to rectify the signal and
demodulate it. You would hear the audio of the signal coming from the speaker!

Harmonics
You can check for harmonics and other spurious emissions with a general coverage
receiver.

TV mast-head ampli ers

145
According to Ofcom’s survey of masthead ampli ers (https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/
assets/pdf_ le/0019/55522/masthead-indoor-ampli er.pdf), the Labgear PWH224 has two
frequency ranges 88 to 470 and 470 to 862 MHz. The Labgear website features the
LMA415VR with ranges 87 to 230 and 470 to 782 MHz.
Which amateur radio frequency is covered by those ranges and could cause interference?
Yes, the 2 m band.

Intermediate frequency
The intermediate frequency ampli ers could be a way in for interference. You need to
know that radio intermediate frequencies are in the range 455 to 500 MHz and at 10.7
MHz. Digital TV receivers use intermediate frequencies between 4 and 39 MHz. Therefore
a spurious harmonic or intermodulation product could lie within those ranges.
You also need to know some typical frequencies for radio and television receivers.
Medium wave radio is in the range 526 to 1606 kHz
VHF FM radio is 87.5 to 108 MHz
VHF DAB is 174 to 230 MHz
TV broadcast is 470 to 790 MHz
Which amateur bands lie within those ranges? Can you make the result of 90 MHz from
intermodulation products of amateur radio frequencies?
An example would be a domestic medium wave radio picking up interference from an HF
transmitter. You need to realise that a low pass lter would be required in the domestic
radio aerial lead because medium wave transmissions only go up to about 1.6 MHz.

Disgruntled neighbours
You de nitely do not want to annoy your neighbours! If you do get a complaint from a
neighbour that you are causing interference, you will need to nd out the cause of the
problem, and perhaps help them by tting lters on the affected device. You can get
information lea ets from the RSGB, and advice is available from the RSGB EMC
Committee. As a last resort, Ofcom will help with the matter.
If you think you have not caused the problem, you will need to show them your log and
compare it to the times when they experienced interference. You need to be co-operative
at all times. If your neighbour is not satis ed with your efforts, both sides can call upon the
RSGB or Ofcom.

Fitting a mobile radio in a car
You might want a professional installer to t a mobile radio. You will need to ensure that
the installation is compatible with the vehicles electrical and management systems, and
does not affect the safety of the car. When you come to test it, the car must be stationary
with its electronic systems operating. Only then can you test it on the road. You might nd
that the car’s ignition and battery charging systems cause interference on your radio. Also,
you should inform your insurance company.

EMC Answers
1. The two basic principles of electromagnetic compatibility are that apparatus should be
able to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment and that it should not
cause undue electromagnetic disturbance to other apparatus.
2. The 3 leads which would require ltering are power, signal and control leads.
3. Having a powerful radio transmitter in your home, you must be aware that it can give
rise to RF elds stronger than the agreed limits.
4. Your new purchase of electronic equipment should meet the British Standards Institute
immunity requirements. This may not be the case with poorly installed equipment.
5. You would recognise that your speech transmissions, particularly on AM and SSB, are
causing interference by speech-like sounds in analogue radio, audio systems and
telephones.
6. You would recognise that your speech FM transmissions are causing interference by
muting or reducing the volume of signals on your radio.
7. Non-radio sources of interference include arcing thermostats, vehicle ignition systems,
electric motors, computers and peripherals, switch mode power supplies, plasma TVs,
VDSL equipment (very high bit rate digital subscriber line), LED lighting and solar
photovoltaic inverters.
8. You would identify these sources of interference on your radio receiver by buzzing
sounds, when a device switches on or o .
9. Interference to DAB radio would cause a loss or muting of the signal.
10. Interference to digital televisions would cause the picture to freeze or pixelate.
11. Direct pickup is especially an issue in the VHF/UHF bands. The device would be
a ected such that a) when you changed frequency within a band, the interference would
not change b) when you changed bands, the interference would be di erent.
12. Your masthead and download TV ampli er is broadband, meaning that it not only
ampli es the TV signal, but your amateur radio transmissions as well. As a result, the
ampli er and/or the TV input could be overloaded.
13. You can minimise RF energy entering the mains wiring by using a lter in the lead to
the power supply of the transmitter.
14. You can minimise RF energy, from HF and VHF, entering electronic equipment by
using ferrite ring lters on the a ected equipment.
15. You would reduce the interference from RF, electric motors and the thermostat to TV,
radio and audio systems by using a mains lter.
16. The di erential mode currents carry the signal information, the outgoing and return
currents are in opposite directions and they do not cause interference. Common mode
currents do not carry information, the currents are in the same direction and they are the
cause of much interference.
17. A ferrite ring or choke on a twin wire feeder can attenuate common mode signals by
virtue of its high impedance.
18. To check for spurious and harmonic emissions from your station you would use
another receiver. You would check for signals on the harmonic frequencies.
19. You would use a dummy load to check if interference is being caused by a radiated
signal. You could put the dummy load on the transmitter rst of all to eliminate it from
your investigation. If the interference is still there, you need to look elsewhere. If the
interference stops, you have found the culprit. Next you replace the antenna with the
dummy load to see if the feeder is causing the interference.
20. A good RF earth is a copper rod, 1 to 2 metres long, hammered into the ground, close
to where the feeders enter your shack or house. It is connected by thick copper cable to
the transmitter.

21. A good RF earth is needed because we need a return path for the antenna current.
We don’t want the RF current to enter the mains wiring.
22. When siting your antenna in the loft, you need to keep it away from mains wiring, TV
or radio antennas and down-leads.

b) they should not be run near electronic control units.
24. The systems that can be a ected by radio frequency energy in your car, particularly
when the output is 10 W or more, are the vehicle electronic circuits, audio systems,
navigation systems, remote locking, alarms and the engine fuel management systems.

Safety
How safe is your radio equipment? You may nd that your are asked to help your club
with a special event station, so you need to be aware of the risks involved. With the
licence allowing you to transmit with 1000 W of power, safety has become paramount.
These are some precautions you need to take in your shack.

High Voltages
Voltages as low as 30 volts can be dangerous. For British Gas electricians, the maximum
touch voltage is 50 volts. Involuntary muscle spasms can be caused by a few
milliamperes. 100 mA can stop your heart. One electrician’s advice is ‘be vigilant’.

Electrical Precautions
Some equipment may use valves which operate at voltage over 200 volts, with some
ampli ers using over 2 kV.
High value capacitors can hold their charge for a long time, as long as days!
All equipment should have on e master switch, its position known to your family or club
members. The switch controlling mains supplies should be double pole, to isolate the live
and neutral.
Indicator lamps show that equipment is live. If faulty they must be replaced immediately.
Switch o equipment before inspecting.
If you need to have the equipment on and working, use only hand with the other in your
pocket. This prevents current going from arm to arm across your heart. Ideally have
another person working with you who knows CPR. Wear shoes with an insulated sole.
Remove watches and jewellery.
Test probes should be good quality insulated tools
Don’t wear headphones in case a sudden noise startles you.

Outdoor operating
When operating in temporary premises or outdoors further hazards are introduced.
Be aware of the location of overhead power lines. Do a site survey before erecting your
antenna.
That site survey should include the ground itself. Some club members set up an antenna
on a slope which they thought was solid ground. Some time later, there was a ground slip
and the antenna collapsed!
Consider trailing cables as a trip hazard.
Use correct fuses and check for damage and to leads
Use RCBO’s.
If the ground is damp, use a rubber mat
Do not make adjustments or repairs to live equipment.
If you are operating abroad be aware that mains supplies may be a di erent voltage or
frequency.
Also di erent plugs and sockets may not be suitable for UK equipment.
Check RF exposure to the public.
Cables must be waterproof for outdoor use.
For indoors consider the routing of cables and the need to cover with a rubber protector.
Do a written risk assessment to identify any hazards and what measures are needed to
minimise the risk. Consider what is the likelihood of harm and its severity. You or your
club should have appropriate public insurance.

Use of a generator
It should be located away from people to avoid carbon monoxide fumes, with possibly a
CO alarm. The area should be well ventilated with barriers around the generator.
Refuel when it is shut o with another person holding a re extinguisher. Note that the
engine block or exhaust can be an ignition hazard.
The fuel should be stored away from the generator.
The re extinguisher should be of the right type and kept near the generator but away
from the fuel.
The generator should have a special ground terminal to connect to a ground rod with
heavy gauge wire.

Mobile operating
In a car or on boat you need to be aware of the following hazards.
Equipment must be securely installed so that sudden braking does not injure the
occupants.
Mobile antennas should not be so long and exible the they present a possible danger to
other cars or pedestrians. What is a reasonable height above ground?
The radio needs to be connected to the positive of the battery by the correct fuse. The
negative lead connects to the chassis and is not fused.
Cable routing should not be hazardous to the driver or passengers, both mechanically
and electrically.
One can operate amateur radio with a hand held microphone, unlike a mobile phone, but
it is not recommended. It could a ect your insurance and your concentration while
driving.
If you must use your radio when mobile use a hands free device.
According to the exam speci cation you need to recall that advice on mobile installations
is given in the Federation of Communication Services (FCS) UK Code of Practice (https://
www.fcs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FCS-1362-2016.pdf)

Lightning
There is already a lot of electricity in the atmosphere, never mind in the ionosphere, even
close to the ground. On an ordinary day, over at ground or over the sea, the electric
potential increases by about 100 volts for every metre upwards. (https://
www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_09.html) There is a potential di erence of about 200
volts between your nose and your feet!
According to NASA (https://lightning.nsstc.nasa.gov/primer/primer2.html ) ice particles in
a cloud grow, collide and break apart. The smaller particles acquire a positive voltage,
while the larger particles acquire a negative charge. Gravity and updraft cause the
particles to separate, producing a charge separation of enormous potential within the
cloud and between the cloud and ground. The voltage in thunderstorms can reach
millions of volts. Eventually the electric potential overcomes the resistance of the air and
lightning strikes in the form of an electrical discharge. A typical lightning strike, or stroke,
can consist of many discharges, as many as ten. Each stroke can have a current from 2
to 200 thousand amperes. You can imagine the damage that would cause to your radio!

protect radio equipment from
static electricity. It features an
ultra-fast gas discharge tube
that can safely shunt up to
5000A to the ground.
As your antenna could be the
line of least resistance you
should disconnect it, leaving
the connector away from your
equipment.
If you are likely to be away, you
could instal a static discharge
system.
At the end of the day, it can be
down to good or bad luck!

Exposure to Radio Frequency Fields
In the Full Licence reference data, Schedule 3, there is some information about conditions
relating to Electromagnetic Fields. A requirement in your licence is to check that you are
compliant with Electromagnetic Field, EMF, exposure limits. You are required to calculate
the ‘compliance distance’ that people need to be from your antennas. See Ofcom’s
guidance https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_ le/0025/214459/guidance-emfcompliance-enforcement.pdf The RSGB have provided a calculator for you. https://
rsgb.org/main/technical/emc/emf-exposure/
In effect, you are working out the EMF Exclusion Zone for your station. No member of the
family, or the general public, should be allowed within that zone, while you are transmitting!
You need to keep a written record of the assessments that you carry out. However other
licensees and workers
The rules apply to any transmitter operating with more than 10 W EIRP, which is the same
as 6.1 W ERP. Therefore you must do an assessment as your permitted power could be
more than 6 W ERP, taking into account the gain of your antenna. Record your results for
all your radios. Your 5 W handheld will be exempt in normal use but if you add a Yagi you
would need to carry out an assessment.
The International Commission for Non-ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) produces
guidance for exposure to RF elds.
This is the link to RSGB’s Ofcom Consultation about Proposed measures, 28 May 2020

The RF energy can be absorbed by the body and cause heating to the body tissue. The
recommended safe exposure levels are set by the ICNIRP and should not be exceeded,
especially at locations open to the public who would be unaware fo the dangers.

Protective Multiple Earthing, PME
In PME systems the main earth terminal is connected to the neutral conductor where the
electricity enters your home. An alternative description is the TN-C-S system, where the
letters indicate that the neutral and earth are separate in the installation equipment, but
are combined within the supply. (T = Terre, meaning Earth, C-S = combined then
separate). This is shown in the diagram taken from the electrical apprentice website.
(https://electricalapprentice.co.uk/an-introduction-to-earthing-and-bonding/)

The earthing is provided by the combined protective and neutral conductors of the
supply. The word ‘multiple’ is relevant when the combined neutral earth conductor is
earthed at multiple points of the supply. The protective earth and neutral conductor have
a low impedance path to earth.

Under severe fault conditions PME systems have the potential to cause fatal electric
shocks and res in amateur radio stations. So what could possibly go wrong? The
protective earth and neutral conductor could go open circuit, meaning it is broken.
Neutral currents could then cause hazardous voltages in the earthing system. This

diagram is taken from ‘Protective Equipotential Bonding’ by Geo Crenshaw, published
by the IET. The fault current is shown as If.

Ofcom does not expect us to be able to do the wiring for our home, but we should be

Answers
1. High voltages are dangerous because they can cause electrocution.
2. High currents dangerous because there is a risk of overheating and re.

fuse because it only takes about 30 mA to earth to be detected while a fuse will only blow
at several amps.
4. A 13 A fuse is tted to equipment requiring a 3 A fuse. This could cause the cable to
overheat if there is a problem without the fuse blowing.
5. The rst action in the event of an accident with electricity is to turn o the power at the
main switch which should be clearly marked.
6. 2 reasons why wires should not be trailed across the oor are a) they are a trip hazard
and b) the insulation could become frayed.
7. 5 precautions when erecting an antenna on a roof are a) wear a hard hat b) work with

10. When charging a battery you need to do so in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions especially lithium batteries which can cause re and explosion if not treated
properly and be aware that you must use the correct type of charger.
11. The District Network Operator should be consulted before making changes to your
earthing arrangements such as an RF earth.

16. The main health e ect of exposure to electromagnetic radiation is heating of body
tissue, with the eyes particularly susceptible to damage.
17. You can get guidance on the safe levels of RF radiation from Public Health England
and the ICNIRP, the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection.
18. A waveguide is used to transmit microwaves. It can be dangerous to look down it or
to stand in front of it, especially high gain antennas.
19. Antenna elements carrying RF should not be touched whilst transmitting. They should
be mounted where people will not come into accidental contact with them.
20. High antennas may need special protection with lightning. Advice can be given by the

antenna is secured and well away from overhead power cables, which could give you a
lethal electric shock.
22. When you are operating outdoors or in temporary premises, new hazards can be
temporary mains connections, trailing cables and damp ground. Therefore you should
take additional safety precautions with risk assessments, cable routing, protection,
correct fusing, use RCBO’s and not to make adjustments or repairs to live equipment.
23. The responsibility for safety is everyone’s. You need to warn the appropriate person if
you are unsure of anything. This also applies in your own home, when entertaining
visitors.
24. Before working on equipment which has large or high-voltage capacitors, you should
discharge any electric charge, using large value resistors to provide a leakage path.
25. The di erent types of fuses that may be in equipment are quick blow or slow blow, to
allow for an initial surge of current.
26. The current in a 1 kW device would be 1000/230 = 4.3 A. Therefore a 5 A fuse would
be suitable.
27. It would be reasonable to work on live equipment only if it is not practicable to do
otherwise, and that you have taken appropriate precautions.
28. The two things you need to be aware of when working with a car battery are rstly,
that it can provide very high currents which can start a re, and secondly, that its contents
are corrosive.
29. When charging a car battery you should be aware of explosive hydrogen given o , so

slipping or rotating.
32. When using a drill, you should ensure that the locking key or chuck key has been
removed, as it could be ejected at high speed.
33. You can help prevent a drill bit from slipping by rst using a centre punch.
34. A bench mounted pillar drill is safer than a hand held drill because it will not slip and
your hands are away from the actual drilling.
35. When you are transmitting 50 W, with a high gain antenna, the sort of compliance
distance would be several metres.
36. When operating mobile, you should ensure that pedestrians are not inside your EMF

Measurements
The topic of measurements lends itself to lots of activities and calculations. The good
news is that it is the last topic!

The E ect of the Test Meter
An analogue milliammeter uses a moving coil inside a magnetic eld to detect a current. It
can be accurate, sensitive and reasonably robust. Its advantage over digital meters is that
you can see a change as the needle moves. This would be the case if you are tuning for a
maximum value.
When an ammeter or a voltmeter is inserted in a circuit, they should not a ect it in any
way. To measure the current in a circuit, an ammeter is placed in series. Its resistance
should be small compared to the resistance in the circuit. Ideally its resistance should be
zero.
Similarly when a voltmeter is place in parallel with a component, it should not change the
potential di erence it is measuring. In practice a very small current passes through the
meter. Ideally its resistance should be in nite!

Multipliers and Shunts
Ammeters
To convert a milliammeter to an ammeter requires a low value resistor in parallel, which is
called a shunt. For example, the coil has a resistance of 1000 Ω and its full scale
de ection, fsd, happens when 100 μA (0.0001 A) passes. We want it to read 1 A for the
same current. Therefore 1.0 - 0.0001 amperes must pass through the shunt resistor.

We use the fact that the potential di erences across the coil and the shunt are the same.
p.d across meter = p.d across shunt
Let R = the resistance of the shunt.
0.0001 x 1000 = 0.9999 x R
R = (0.1/0.9999) = 0.1 Ω
The total resistance of shunt and coil in parallel will be very small and will not a ect the
current in the circuit.

Voltmeters
To convert a milliammeter to a voltmeter requires a high value resistor, called a multiplier,
in series with the meter. For example we want the same meter as above to read 1 V when
100 μA passes. When the meter and multiplier in series are placed in the circuit, it will
give a reading of one volt.

The p.d across both the meter and multiplier = 1 V
(0.0001 x 1000) + (0.0001 x R). = 1 V
0.1 + (0.0001 x R) = 1
(0.0001 x R) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9
R = 0.9/0.0001 = 9000 Ω
The combined resistance of the multiplier and coil is 9000 + 1000, or 10,000Ω. This is
reasonably high enough for the voltmeter not to disturb the circuit too much if the
resistance in the circuit is up to 1000Ω. Anything higher will give problems as the next
example shows. A digital meter would be superior, with an input impedance of up to 100
MΩ.
How much error is introduced if we use the voltmeter is this circuit with 500 and 1000 Ω,
and a 1.5 volt cell? We expect a potential di erence of 0.5 V across the 500 Ω and 1.0 V
across the 1000 Ω. Introducing the voltmeter in the circuit changes the current.

ff

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

160
The combined resistance of 1000 Ω and voltmeter is
R = (1000 x 10,000)/(1000 + 10,000) = 10,000/11 = 909 Ω
The current in the circuit is now
I = 1.5/(909 + 500) = 1.06 mA instead of 1.0 mA
The potential di erence across the 1000 Ω resistor with be 1.06 V, which is a 6% error.
RS Components have a useful complete guide to ammeters here (https://uk.rsonline.com/web/content/discovery/ideas-and-advice/ammeters-guide)
Activity 16.1 Investigate ammeters and voltmeters
Alternating Current
The moving coil meter can be adapted to measure alternating current by adding a bridge
recti er. This will give a recti ed full wave current. The meter will not oscillate at the
frequency of the current; it will give an average value. However, as we want the rms
current we will need to multiply the average value by 1.11. therefore the ac meter is
calibrated to read rms values.
Why 1.11? This is ratio of the rms value to the average for a sinusoidal oscillating current.
It is called the form factor. if the current is a square waveform or a sawtooth, the form
factor will be di erent.
Yes, but why 1.11? If Ipk is the peak value of a current, the form factor is given by
(Ipk/√2)/(2 x Ipk/π)
= π/(2√2) = 1.11
Simple!

Source Impedance
We met source impedance in the Intermediate. For example, a battery has an emf of 1.5
volts and a source impedance of 0.2Ω . Similarly, a signal source, such as an RF signal
generator or an antenna, can have a source impedance of about 50Ω. If the emf of the
source is 5 volts and it is connected to a 50Ω load, its output voltage will be half of 5
volts, 2.5 volts, as it forms a potential divider.

Another example is an RF signal of 4 μV from an antenna fed to a matched feeder and a
receiver. The input to the receiver will be 2 μV, because the feeder has an impedance of
50 Ω.

161
An oscilloscope will have a high input impedance of about 1 MΩ so it will not a ect
measurement of DC voltages. However at RF, capacitors can have impedances of about
50Ω at high frequencies. If f is 6 MHz and the impedance of the capacitor is 50Ω, what is
its capacitance? Using the formula Xc = 1/ 2πfC, we get values of about 0.05 μF. The
point is that the readings will be incorrect and the probe may a ect the current in the
circuit.

RF Voltage measurement
To measure RF voltages, up to several hundred megahertz, a signal diode is used. It
produces a direct voltage proportional to the peak value of the oscillating voltage. If the
voltage and power are too great, a second diode can used or a potential divider circuit is
used to reduce the voltage. The resistors should be non-inductive.

Peak Envelope Power, PEP
The de nition of PEP in the licence, provided in the exam in Ex309, Notes to Schedule
part (b), is not helpful.
‘PEP is de ned as the power averaged over one RF cycle at the crest of the modulation
envelope’ in the EX309 data booklet.
We need to know what it means, as the licence limits our output power to 1000 W PEP.

SSB
The setup to measure the PEP is shown in the diagram. An audio oscillator is fed to the
transmitter, set to 7.1 MHz for example, with a dummy 50 Ω load, a power meter, labelled
W in the diagram, such as the Bird 43 wattmeter https://birdrf.com/rf-measurement/
wattmeters and an oscilloscope across the load.

With no signal, we get no trace, but with a single tone, 1000 Hz for example, we a single
frequency of constant amplitude.

The envelope is the red line, enveloping the whole trace. The peak voltage, Vpk is shown.
To measure the PEP we apply a two tone signal, that is, two audio frequencies which are
not harmonically related, 700 and 900 Hz for example, not 500 and 1000 Hz.
The trace looks like this, the same as the beats trace in the Intermediate manual.
We note the power reading. The PEP is given by

Peak Envelope Power, PEP = 2 x mean power.
If the power meter reads 100 W, then the PEP is 200 W. If it reads 500 W, then the PEP is
1000 W, our licence limit.

AM
With no signal the trace on the oscilloscope will be as shown, a constant carrier
amplitude.
When a single tone is applied we can adjust the input to the transmitter to give 100%
modulation, where the troughs almost meet.
Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

163

Note that the trace is quite di erent to that of the two tones. The PEP is given by the
formula:

PEP = V2rms/R

The PEP is not twice the mean power, as the waveform is di erent to that of the two tone.
We can now replace the oscillator with a microphone. You can adjust the audio level so
that your voice does not exceed the level of Vpk.

For example, if the voltage peak to peak is 200 volts,
Vpk = 100 V = Vrms/0.7
Therefore Vrms = 0.7 x Vpk = 0.7 x 100 volts
PEP = V2rms/R = (0.7 x 100)2/50
= 0.5 x 100 x 100/50
= 100 W

ff

164
If the Vpk = 200 volts,
PEP = V2rms/R = (0.7 x 200)2/50
= 100 x 200/50
= 400 W

CW, FM
If a Morse key is pressed continuously, the trace on the oscilloscope will be constant
amplitude. Peak Envelope Power for CW and FM can be found in the same way as for
AM.

Frequency measurements
Crystal calibrators
It is essential that you do not transmit outside the bands. Therefore you need an accurate
means of measuring frequency using a frequency counter.
The basic kind is a crystal calibrator, which has a 10 MHz crystal oscillator. Logic chips
provide frequency calibration markers at 1 MHz, 100 kHz and 10 kHz.
Digital frequency counters
The digital frequency counter uses a crystal controlled 1 MHz reference oscillator.
Obviously, it needs to be accurate and precise so temperature stability is important. A
gate allows the signal through and counts the number of cycles in a given time, such as
one millisecond, and the result is passed to the display. The duration of the gate opening
is crucial to give an accurate measurement. If the duration is too short some cycles may
be missed. A one millisecond gate is only accurate to 1 kHz while a one second gate is
accurate to 1 Hz. For example, for a frequency of 135.8 kHz and a gate time of 1 ms, only
135 cycles will be counted.

fi

165
This is Phil G0JBA’s frequency counter. Phil is a microwave operator, at frequencies where
accuracy is vital. He uses built in local oscillators that have an oven, so that once the
design temperature is reached it keeps the local oscillator relatively stable. At 2,320 MHz
it will be within 3 kHz of the actual desired frequency. At higher frequencies, such as on
the 24,048 MHz band, Phil uses a GPS signal to lock the reference oscillator, achieving an
accuracy of 200 Hz to the desired frequency.
The accuracy of a frequency counter is expressed in parts per million, ppm. The error is
given by

error = (frequency in Hz x ppm)/ 1,000,000.

For a 1MHz crystal with an error of 15 ppm,
error = (1,000,000 x15)/1,000,000 = 15
Therefore the error is 15 Hz. The frequency could be from 999,985 to 1,000,015 Hz.
Standard frequency transmissions
The frequency counter itself can be checked against standard frequency transmissions.
The RSGB publish a list. (https://rsgb.org/main/operating/beacons-and-repeaters/vhfuhf-and-microwave-beacons/)
For example, OK0EPB is a beacon in the Czech Republic transmitting on 7039.4 MHz.
GB3AMU is a beacon in Cardi , which transmits a beacon on 24048.940 MHz.

Measurement tolerances
When measuring frequency with a crystal oscillator, various errors need to be considered
to ensure that you transmit within the band plan. Errors could accumulate when
measuring frequency. There are various sources of error
a) The speci cation of the crystal accuracy
For example, the accuracy could be 30 ppm, which means 30 x 10-6 of the frequency
value. If the frequency = 20 MHz, the error could be = 30 x 10-6 x 20 x 10+6, which is 600
Hz.
b) Ageing
Ageing or time related drift could be as much as 2 ppm per year.
c) Stability tolerance
Stability tolerance could be 100 ppm.
We can add all the ppm to give a total value.
The total error could be as much as 3000 Hz at a frequency of 20 MHz. What does that
convert to in ppm?
ppm x 20 x 10+6 = 3000
Therefore ppm = 300/(20 x 10+6) = 150 ppm.

ff

fi

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

166

In using your transmitter you need to aware of its frequency tolerance which could be as
much as 100 ppm. If you are transmitting in the 21 MHz to 21.450 MHz band and
operating AM, the edge is 21.450 MHz.
If all the errors accumulate, we have
transmitter tolerance = 100 ppm
frequency tolerance = 150 ppm
total = 250 ppm
Therefore the error = 250 x 10-6 x 21.45 x 10+6 = 5,362.5 Hz.
Keeping the bandwidth of 2.7 kHz from the edge, gives a total of 21,450 - (2.7 + 5.362) =
21,442 kHz. Therefore you would not operate beyond 21.442 MHz to be on the safe side.

Activity 16.3 Investigate frequency measurements

SWR meter
You have an SWR meter in your shack. You know how to use it.
For the Full Examination, you need to identify the two kinds of meter. Also you need to
understand ‘in simple terms’ how the SWR reading is obtained for the three di erent
types of meter - the single meter, the twin meters and the cross needle twin meter.

Sense Wire SWR meter
The photos show a basic CB SWR meter for 26 to 30 MHz. You can see the wide track on
the printed circuit board where the signal passes. On either side of the track is a wire
which will sense the signal, so that a current is induced in it. This current is recti ed by a
diode and is fed to the meter. The ‘cal’ control sets the forward current to full scale
de ection. When you switch it to reverse current, the meter shows the SWR.
The coupling of the RF signal and the current in the wire increases as the frequency
increases. Sense wire meters are not particularly accurate but can be a useful indicator.
The sense wire can be placed between the inner and outer conductors of the coaxial
cable.

168

Current Transformer SWR meter
In this type of meter the RF signal passes through the ferrite ring of a transformer. A
current is induced in the secondary, consisting of 20 turns of wire around the ring. The
current then passes through a potential divider which produces two voltages for meters
M1 and M2. When calibrated, M1 gives the forward power, M2 gives the reverse power.
The SWR is found from the formula
SWR = (√forward power + √reverse power) / (√forward power - √reverse power)

The Kenwod Antenna Tuner Model AT-130 is more sophisticated with a directional coupler
which samples forward and reverse power from the transceiver to the load. It has a
frequency range of 3.5 to 29.7 MHz. You can see the transformer symbol in the circuit
diagram taken from the manual.
The photo shows a cross needle twin meter, the MFJ-959E. The meter needles cross
indicating the SWR. The current transformer SWR meter is independent of frequency.

Activity 16.3 Measure SWR

The Oscilloscope
We met the oscilloscope in the Intermediate manual as a means of analysing waveforms
in the time domain. Its purpose is to measure voltages and frequencies. It can display a
time varying signal.
An electron beam is controlled by a voltage that make it move across the screen. The
time taken is varied by the time base. When an alternating input voltage is applied, the
beam responds by moving up and down.
Measuring voltage
The oscilloscope can measure ac and dc voltages applied to the Y input. The gain control
is calibrated in volts per division or cm, depending on the oscilloscope. For example, if
the setting is 0.5 V/div and the trace moves 3.2 divisions, then the applied voltage is 1.6
V.
Activity 16.4 Compare rms and peak to peak voltages
Measuring frequency
We can vary the time-base on the oscilloscope to give us the best waveform for
measurements. The rst photo of a 10 kHz sine signal shows the time-base too slow,
while the second photo gives us a perfect waveform. The scale along the time axis is
telling us that every division is 20 microseconds. The wave is occupying 5 divisions.
Therefore the period is 100 microseconds. What is the frequency? This is not an easy
calculation! You could say 1/micro is Mega, so it is 1/100 MHz, or 0.01 MHz. It is better to
change the period to milliseconds. 100 microseconds is 0.1 milliseconds. 1/milli is kilo, so
it is 1/0.1 kilohertz, or 10 kHz.

My oscilloscope has two channels and one can add them. I demonstrated adding two
waveforms, one high frequency and one low, and this was the display - amplitude
modulation.

Activity 16.5 Measure frequencies

The Spectrum Analyser
We met the spectrum analyser in the Intermediate manual as a means of analysing
waveforms in the frequency domain. It analyses a signal in much the same way as an

SDR, using Fourier transforms.
It sweeps across the frequency range that you specify and displays the amplitude of each
frequency.

Copyright © October 2025 John Hislop

172

The TinySA spectrum analyser comes with an excellent website of documentation, videos
and examples.
https://www.tinysa.org/wiki/
According to the website the spectrum analyser is used to measure and view an
electronic signal versus frequency.
The main speci cation points for a spectrum analyser are its frequency range, the
measurement resolution in this frequency range and the signal signal levels that can be
displayed.
The tinySA basic has an MF/HF/VHF input for 0.1 MHz to 350 MHz. One has to be careful
with the input voltage so as not to damage it. The maximum is 10 dBm.
https://tinysa.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Examples has some example displays for

Activity 16.6 investigate a spectrum analyser

Decibels
Using combinations of 3 and 10 dB
A power gain of 3 dB is the same as doubling the power and 10 dB is a power increase of
10 times. If there is a minus sign, it means a power loss or attenuation.
For example, the input signal to an ampli er is 1 mW and the output is 10 W, what is the
power gain in dB? The power gain is 10W/0.001W = 10,000 times. We know from above,
that a 10 dB is the same as a power increase of 10 times. Because 10,000 = 10 x 10 x 10
x 10, we change the x sign to a plus +, so we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 dB. The power
gain in decibels is 40 dB.
To change dB back into a power gain, you have to change the pluses into times, and
minuses into divides. You can see that with the 40 dB, we just reverse the procedure.
40 dB = 10 dB + 10 dB + 10 dB + 10 dB.
But 10 dB is a gain of 10 times, so we change the pluses into times,
Power gain = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10,000 times.
Now we play Countdown! Using just the numbers 3 and 10, how can you make 14?
Answer is + 10 + (10 - 3 - 3).
So what is 14 dB expressed as a power gain, which is speci cally mentioned in the
speci cation, page 2.30? Doing the brackets rst. (10 - 3 - 3) converts to a gain of 10,
followed by a loss of half, followed by another half, which is 10/2 x 1/2 = 10/4 = 2.5.
So the expression + 10 + (10 - 3 - 3) is the same as a gain of 10 times and a gain of 2.5.
Therefore, the whole gain becomes 10 x 2.5, which is 25 times. 14 dB is a gain of 25 W.
Using logs
This is the de nition for decibels:
power gain in dB = 10 log (power out/power in)

So if the power out is twice the power in, there is a gain of 2. The log of 2 is 0.301, so the
power gain in dB is 10 x 0.301 = 3.01. For a power gain of 10, the log of 10 is 1, so the
power gain in dB is 10. Simple!
Let’s try the example above. The input signal to an ampli er is 1 mW and the output is 10
W, what is the power gain in dB? The power gain is 10W/0.001W = 10,000. Using logs,
the log of 10,000 is 4, so the power gain in dB is 10 x 4 = 40 dB.
What about the other example for 14 dB, couldn’t we just use logs? Yes, indeed. The
formula for going the other way is
power out/power in = antilog of (power gain/loss in dB divided by10)
= antilog of 14/10 = antilog of 1.4 = 25.12 W
Which shows that the quick method is actually an approximation.
Reference gain
So far, we have considered a power out bigger or smaller in comparison to a power in.
We can also quote a power with reference to a xed value for the input signal. This is
called a reference level. We have seen that we can compare the power out of an antenna
to either an isotropic radiator, dBi, or to a half wave dipole dBd. We can also use 1 watt,
as the reference level, so the power becomes dBW. At Full Licence, there is dBm,
comparing to 1 mW. For example, a microwave oven has an output power of 1 kW, what
is that in dBW? The power ratio is 1000/1, so the power is 30 dBW.
Another example: a Bluetooth radio system has a maximum output power of 1 mW at
2.45 GHz. What is its power is dBW? The power ratio is 0.001/1, which is 1/1000 or 1/10
x 1/10 x 1/10. Therefore the power is -30 dBW. Better to change it to 1dBm, but that will
have to wait till you do the Full licence course!
Gain in dBV.
Power in dBm is mentioned above. The only new item in the Full speci cation is dBV.
If you are working in voltages rather than power, then we use 20 instead of 10, because
power is related to the square of the voltage. The gain in dBV is given by
gain or loss = 20 log (Vout/Vin)
For example an ampli er increases the voltage of a signal from 1 mV to 1V, what is its
gain?
gain = 20 log (1 V/1 mV) = 20 log 1000 = 20 x 3 = 60 dBV.
Now try question 17 in the section Measurements Questions!

Temperature e ect on Components
Temperature has an e ect on the value of components. Those with negative coe cients
will reduce in value as temperature rises whereas those with positive coe cients will
increase in value. For example, in a resonance circuit, using the product of LC, the
inductor could have a value of 200 μH and the capacitor 100 pF. If the inductor has a

positive temperature coe cient of 3 parts in one million, 3 ppm, we multiply its value by 3
x 10-6 and add the result.
new L = 200 μH + (3 x 10-6 x 200) = 200 + 6 x 10-4 μH = 200.0006 μH
Similarly for the capacitor, but with a negative temperature coe cient, which must be the
same amount, but negative.
new C = 100 pF - (3 x 10-6 x 100) = 100 - 3 x 10-4 pF = 99.9996 pF
Therefore, before LC = 200 μH x 100 pF = 20,000 μHpF
Now LC = 200.0006 μH x 99.9996 pF = 19,999.98 μHpF
Why don’t the values of L and C a ect the required temperature coe cients; why do the
temperature coe cients need to be the same amount, but opposite? C can be any
multiple of L such as 4 times, it doesn’t make any di erence.
The new product of LC is (L + (3 x 10-6 x L)) x (C - (3 x 10-6 x C))
Which is
= LC - (3 x 10-6 LC) + (3 x 10-6 LC) - (9 x 10-12 LC)
= LC - (9 x 10-12 LC)
The last term is negligible, we are back to just LC.
In practice, we use components for L and C with low values of temperature coe cient
and site them away from sources of heat.

Answers
1. The potential di erence V = IR = 100 μA x 1200 Ω = (100 x10-6) x 1.2 x 103 = 1.2 x10-4
x 103 = 10-1 = 0.12 volts
2. The current passing through the multiplier resistor will be 100uA. If the potential
di erence is 10.0 volts the total resistance R will be V/I = 10.0/10-4 = 105 = 100 000 Ω.
The meter resistance is 1000 Ω so a 99,000 Ω resistor is required for the multiplier.
3. When the voltmeter is placed in the circuit 100uA will be drawn from it to make the
moving coil meter work. This should be negligible compared to the main current in the
circuit. The actual voltage will be higher than the measured voltage by a negligible
amount.
4. The p.d. across the meter and the resistor is 0.12 volts. Of the 1.0 A, 100 μA goes
through the meter leaving (10.0 - 0.0001) A through the resistor. This is 9.9999 A.
Therefore the resistance R = V/I = 0.13/9.9999 = 0.013 Ω.
5. When the ammeter is placed in the circuit it adds 0.013 Ω to the resistance in the
circuit. This should be negligible if the resistor in the circuit is 1k Ω for example. The
actual current will be higher than the measured current by a negligible amount.
6. Analogue meters should be shorted when carried, so that any induced current acts to
damp the movement of the coil. Also when rst using the meter one should make sure
that the setting is at its highest current or voltage value to prevent overloading the coil.
7.
a) The three sources of error when taking frequency measurements are the measurement
tolerance, calibration accuracy and time related drift or ageing.
b) These errors can accumulate to give as much an error of 3.4 kHz in a reading of 1.8
MHz, a percentage error of 0.2%.
c) You need to be more than 3.4 kHz away from the edge of the band plan in case the
errors are more.
8. E ectively we have a potential divider so that the output signal is halved. This however
transfers maximum power, when the source impedance equals the circuit impedance.

9.
a) As in the previous question we have a potential divider, so the signal level will be only 5
V rms, which is a peak value of 5 x 1.4 = 7 V.
b) The peak to peak value is 14 V. For a setting of 5 V per division, we have 14/5 or 2.8
divisions.
10. A steady audio signal from a signal oscillator is used on the AM or SSB carrier. It is
fed into the dummy load with an RF meter containing a diode in parallel to measure the
potential di erence.
11. The resistance = 50 Ω, so the power is (VxV)/R = 10 x 10 / 50 = 2 W.

12. The decibel power dB is de ned by 10 log10 (power out/power in).
The decibel power dBW is an absolute measurement compared to 1 watt. For example 9
dBW is 9 dB up on 1W which is 8 W.
The decibel power dBm is compared to 1mW. So -20 dBm is 1/100 of a milliwatt or 10
μW.
The decibel power dBd is the gain in power of a yagi antenna over a dipole.
The decibel power dBi is the gain in power of yagi compared to a vertical or isotropic
antenna.
13. We add the gains because they are logs, so 12 = 3 + 3 + 3 +3. To nd the increase in
power we multiply, as every 3dB is a gain of 2, so we have 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16. The power
increase is 16. We can check this by taking the log of 16 on the calculator. It gives 1.204,
which is multiplied by 10 to give 12.
14. 0dB would mean no gain, so that the power out = power in.
15. The gain is 20 log10 voltage out/voltage in, which is 20 log 10. Log of 10 is 1 so the
decibel gain is 20 dBV.
16. Log 50 is 1.69897 which rounded up is 1.7. To nd the dBW we use gain = 10 log 50
= 17, so the decibel power gain is 17 dBW.
17. Using multiply and dividing
We need to nd the power loss so that when the formula is used, it gives -104 dB. First
we divide by 10 to give 10.4. On my calculator I enter 10.4 and press the 10x button,
which gives 2.5 x (10 to the power of 10). As this is a loss we have to divide. So the 5W
becomes 5/(2.5 x10 to the power 10), which is 2 x (10 to the negative power of 10), so the
answer is 0.2 nW.
Using adding and subtracting
First we convert 5 W to dBm, which is 10 log (5W /1 mW) = 10 log (5000)
= 10 x 3.7 = 37 dBm.
We lose 104 dB. Therefore we now have 37 - 104 = - 67 dBm.
Using antilogs, -67 = 10 log (power out/power in)
So power out/power in = antilog of -6.7 = 2 x 10-7 .
Power in = 1 mW, so power out = 10-3 x 2 x 10-7 = 0.2 nW
Which method do you prefer?!

18. The peak envelope power (PEP) of an SSB transmission is the power averaged over
one cycle at the crest of the modulation envelope.

19. The peak to peak is 4 V and the peak voltage is 2 volts. So the rms value is 0.707 x 2
= 1.414 V.
20. The period of the wave is 2 μs. The reciprocal is 1000 000/2 or 500 000 Hz = 500 kHz.
21. One wave has a period of 1/10.0 k = 1/(10 x 103 )= 0.1 ms. Therefore 2 waves give 0.2
ms for the 10 divisions. Ideally we want a time base of (0.2 ms/10) ms/division or 0.02 ms/
division. This is better converted to 20 μs/div.
A time base of 50 μs/div would give too many waves (too slow). A time base of 10 μs/div
(too fast) would give just one wave, as 10 divisions would give a time across the screen of
100 μs or 0.1 ms, which is the period of our wave.
22. A spectrum analyser is used to display the frequencies transmitted so that any
harmonics can be found. You would know the fundamental frequency so you would be
looking for multiples of that frequency.
23.One type of SWR meter has a sense wire between the inner and outer conductors of
the coax while the other has a current transformer and a capacitative voltage tap.
24. A single meter would have a switch to change from power in the forward direction to
the reverse power. Twin meters read both powers and a cross needle meter works such
when the forward and reverse needles cross, the SWR is indicated where they cross.
