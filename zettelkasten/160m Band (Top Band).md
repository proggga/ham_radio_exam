# 160m Band (1.8 MHz)

Known as "Top Band". It behaves more like Medium Wave broadcast than typical HF.

## Characteristics
*   **Frequency:** 1.8 - 2.0 MHz.
*   **Propagation:**
    *   **Day:** Strong **D-layer absorption**. Range limited to Ground Wave (40-120 miles).
    *   **Night:** D-layer disappears. F-layer reflection allows DX (1000+ miles), especially in Winter.
*   **Noise:** Very High (S3-S7 typical). Susceptible to thunderstorms (Summer static) and man-made QRM.

## Usage
*   **Best For:** Local ragchewing (Day/Night), Regional/DX (Winter Nights).
*   **Antennas:** Requires massive antennas (~253 ft dipole). Inverted-L often used.
*   **Solar Cycle:** Works BEST at **Solar Minimum**.
