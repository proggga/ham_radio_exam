# Field Repair Techniques

When equipment fails in the field, knowing how to improvise repairs is essential for maintaining communications.

## Antenna Repair

### Whip Antennas
If a whip antenna breaks:
1.  **Both parts available**: Clean the broken ends and lash them together securely with wire or tape to ensure electrical contact.
2.  **Part lost**: Add a piece of wire of similar length to the missing section. Lash it to the remaining base section.
    *   *Note*: The total length must be restored to the original length to maintain resonance.

### Wire Antennas
1.  **Broken Wire**: Clean ends and twist them together. Solder if possible.
2.  **Replacement**: If damaged beyond repair, replace with any available wire (copper or aluminum is best) of the **exact same length**.

### Insulators
If an insulator breaks, use improvised non-conductive materials:
*   **Best**: Plastic (spoons, buttons, bags, bottle necks) or Glass.
*   **Fair**: Dry Wood, Nylon Rope.
*   **Technique**: Ensure the antenna wire does not touch the support (tree/pole) or ground.

### Guys and Masts
*   **Guys**: Repair broken ropes by tying. Lengthen short ropes with dry wood or cloth.
*   **Masts**: Overlap and lash broken pole sections together.

## Construction Tips
*   **Tree Supports**: Use a spring, old inner tube, or a pulley with a weight on the antenna end to prevent breakage when trees sway in the wind.
*   **Testing**:
    *   **Receive Test**: Tune to a distant station. Adjust antenna length/height for maximum volume.
    *   **Transmit Test**: Use an [[Matching and SWR|SWR Meter]] to check for impedance mismatch.
