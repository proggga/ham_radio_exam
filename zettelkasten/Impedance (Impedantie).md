# Impedance (Impedantie)

Impedance ($Z$) is the total opposition to current flow in an AC circuit, combining Resistance ($R$) and Reactance ($X$).
*   **Unit**: Ohm ($\Omega$).

## Vector Addition
Because Resistance and Reactance are $90^\circ$ out of phase, they must be added as vectors (Pythagoras).

### Series Circuits
$$Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}$$

### Parallel Circuits
$$\frac{1}{Z} = \sqrt{(\frac{1}{R})^2 + (\frac{1}{X})^2}$$
