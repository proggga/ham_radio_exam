# Measurements

## 1. Voltage Measurement
*   **Instrument:** Voltmeter.
*   **Connection:** **Parallel** to the component being measured.
*   **Ideal Property:** Infinite internal resistance ($R_i = \infty$).
    *   *Why?* To draw zero current and not affect the circuit voltage.

## 2. Current Measurement
*   **Instrument:** Ammeter (Ampèremeter).
*   **Connection:** **In Series** with the circuit (the circuit must be broken to insert the meter).
*   **Ideal Property:** Zero internal resistance ($R_i = 0$).
    *   *Why?* To cause zero voltage drop and not reduce the circuit current.

## 3. Resistance Measurement
*   **Instrument:** Ohmmeter.
*   **Connection:** Component must be **removed** or isolated from the circuit (Voltage off).
*   **Method:** The meter injects a small known current and measures the resulting voltage drop to calculate R.

| Measurement | Connection | Ideal Resistance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Voltage** | Parallel | Very High ($\infty$) |
| **Current** | Series | Very Low ($0$) |
| **Resistance**| Component Isolated | N/A |
