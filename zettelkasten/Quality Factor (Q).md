# Quality Factor (Q)

$Q$ is a measure of the efficiency of a resonant circuit (Ratio of stored energy to energy lost per cycle).

## Characteristics
*   **High Q**: Sharp resonance peak, narrow bandwidth (High selectivity).
*   **Low Q**: Broad resonance peak, wide bandwidth.

## Formulas
*   **Series Circuit**: $Q = \frac{X_L}{R_s}$
    *   Lower series resistance ($R_s$) $\rightarrow$ Higher Q.
*   **Parallel Circuit**: $Q = \frac{R_p}{X_L}$
    *   Higher parallel resistance ($R_p$) $\rightarrow$ Higher Q.
