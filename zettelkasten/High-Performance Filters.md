# High-Performance Filters

For receiver selectivity (Intermediate Frequency stages), simple LC filters are often insufficient. Special mechanical or piezoelectric filters are used.

## Types
1.  **Crystal [[Filters & Resonance|Filter]]**: Uses quartz crystals.
    *   Very high $Q$, very steep edges (good shape factor).
    *   Used for [[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]] (narrow) and [[CW Abbreviations & Prosigns|CW]] (very narrow) modes.
2.  **Mechanical Filter**: Resonates mechanically (metal disks).
    *   High $Q$, distinctive flat top passband.
    *   Common in older high-quality receivers (Collins).
3.  **Ceramic Filter**: Uses piezoelectric ceramics.
    *   Cheaper, medium performance.
    *   Common in broadcast radios and lower-cost transceivers.
    *   Often used for [[Frequency Modulation (FM)|FM]] bandwidths.
