# Detectors, Oscillators & Mixers

This map covers the key functional blocks of radio circuits (excluding amplifiers).

## Signal Generation
*   **[[Oscillators]]** - Creating AC signals (LC, Crystal).
*   **[[Phase Locked Loop (PLL)]]** - Synthesizing stable frequencies.

## Signal Processing
*   **[[Mixers]]** - Frequency conversion and Image frequency.
*   **[[Detectors (Demodulators)]]** - Extracting audio ([[Analogue Modulation & AM|AM]], [[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]], [[Frequency Modulation (FM)|FM]]).

## Related
*   **[[Superheterodyne Receiver]]** - System using all these blocks.
*   **[[Modulation & Digital Signals]]** - The signals being processed.
