# Field Expedient Antennas

When standard antennas are broken or unavailable, functional antennas can be constructed from available materials.

## Materials
*   **Wire**: Field wire, electrical cord, or even fence wire.
*   **Insulators**: Plastic spoons, buttons, bottle necks, plastic bags, dry wood, nylon rope.
*   **Supports**: Trees, wooden poles, buildings.

## Types

### 1. Vertical Wire Antenna
*   **Construction**: A wire suspended vertically from a tree limb or pole.
*   **[[Equipment Safety Classes|Insulation]]**: The top must be insulated from the support. The bottom should be insulated from the ground.
*   **Grounding**: Requires a ground stake or counterpoise wires for efficiency.
*   **Characteristics**: Omnidirectional. Good for low-angle radiation (DX).

### 2. End-Fed Half-Wave
*   **Construction**: A wire cut to $\lambda/2$ connected to the radio at one end.
*   **Tuning**: Prune the length for best reception/transmission.
*   **Grounding**: Essential for the radio chassis.

### 3. Center-Fed Doublet
*   **Construction**: Two $\lambda/4$ wires fed in the center with a transmission line (twisted pair or coax).
*   **Support**: Can be horizontal (dipole) or inverted-V (single center support).
*   **Polarization**: Horizontal (if flat) or Mixed (if Inverted-V).

### 4. V-Antenna (Jungle)
*   **Construction**: A wire fed at the bottom, running up to a tree limb, and then sloping down to another support (Inverted V shape) or two wires forming a V.
*   **Directionality**: Using terminating resistors (500-600 $\Omega$) at the far ends makes it directional (toward the open end of the V).

### 5. Long-Wire Antenna
*   **Construction**: A single wire, preferably $> 2\lambda$ long.
*   **Directionality**: Directional off the ends (lobes tighten with length).
*   **Termination**: Can be terminated with a resistor (approx $500-600 \Omega$) to ground at the far end to make it uni-directional.

### 6. Vertical Half-Rhombic
*   **Construction**: A wire supported by a center pole (like an inverted V), but the ends are close to the ground.
*   **Feed**: Fed at one end, terminated with a resistor at the other.
*   **Use**: Good for point-to-point communications.

## Siting Considerations
*   **Height**: Higher is generally better.
*   **Clearance**: Keep away from wet foliage (absorbs RF).
*   **Orientation**: Broadside to the wire transmits best (for dipoles).
