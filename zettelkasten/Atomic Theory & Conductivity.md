# Atomic Theory & Conductivity

This is a structure note for concepts related to the physics of matter and electricity.

## Core Concepts
*   **[[Atomic Structure]]** - The building blocks (Protons, Neutrons, Electrons).
*   **[[Electrical Charge (Coulomb)]]** - The fundamental property that causes electrical force (Coulombs).
*   **[[Ions (Ionisation)]]** - Atoms with net charge (Ionization).

## Material Properties
*   **[[Conductors and Insulators]]** - How materials behave based on their electron structure.
*   **[[Resistivity (Soortelijke Weerstand)]]** - The specific resistance of materials.
*   **[[Semiconductors]]** - Materials that can act as either.

## Connected Topics
*   **[[Voltage, Current, and Ohm's Law]]** - How charge flow (Current) relates to force (Voltage).
*   **[[The Ionosphere]]** - Large scale ionization affecting radio waves.
