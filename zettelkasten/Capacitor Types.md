# Capacitor Types

## Fixed Capacitors
*   **Ceramic**: General purpose, RF coupling/decoupling.
*   **Plastic Film**: Stable, audio/power applications.
*   **Mica**: High stability, high Q, used in filters.

## Electrolytic Capacitors (Elco)
*   **Characteristics**: High capacitance per volume.
*   **Polarized**: Has Positive (+) and Negative (-) terminals.
    *   **Warning**: Connecting in reverse causes explosion/failure.
    *   **Use**: Power supply smoothing, audio coupling.

## Frequency Characteristics
*   **[[Propagation Basics|HF]]/[[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]] Applications:**
    *   **Ceramic:** Preferred for [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]] (e.g., 145 MHz) due to low inductance.
    *   **Air/Vacuum:** Lowest losses (best dielectric) for [[Propagation Basics|HF]] applications.
    *   **Value:** Typical tuning capacitor for Shortwave ([[Propagation Basics|HF]]) is ~100 pF (compared to ~500 pF for Medium Wave).

## Variable Capacitors
*   **Air Variable**: Rotatable metal plates meshing together. Used for VFO tuning and [[Antenna & Tower Safety|Antenna]] Matching.
*   **Trimmer**: Small adjustable capacitor for screwdriver calibration.

## Breakdown Voltage
The maximum voltage the dielectric can withstand before arcing occurs. Exceeding this destroys the component.
