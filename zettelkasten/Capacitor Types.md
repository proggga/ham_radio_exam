# Capacitor Types

## Fixed Capacitors
*   **Ceramic**: General purpose, RF coupling/decoupling.
*   **Plastic Film**: Stable, audio/power applications.
*   **Mica**: High stability, high Q, used in filters.

## Electrolytic Capacitors (Elco)
*   **Characteristics**: High capacitance per volume.
*   **Polarized**: Has Positive (+) and Negative (-) terminals.
    *   **Warning**: Connecting in reverse causes explosion/failure.
    *   **Use**: Power supply smoothing, audio coupling.

## Frequency Characteristics
*   **HF/VHF Applications:**
    *   **Ceramic:** Preferred for VHF (e.g., 145 MHz) due to low inductance.
    *   **Air/Vacuum:** Lowest losses (best dielectric) for HF applications.
    *   **Value:** Typical tuning capacitor for Shortwave (HF) is ~100 pF (compared to ~500 pF for Medium Wave).

## Variable Capacitors
*   **Air Variable**: Rotatable metal plates meshing together. Used for VFO tuning and Antenna Matching.
*   **Trimmer**: Small adjustable capacitor for screwdriver calibration.

## Breakdown Voltage
The maximum voltage the dielectric can withstand before arcing occurs. Exceeding this destroys the component.
