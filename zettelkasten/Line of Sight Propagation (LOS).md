# Line of Sight Propagation (LOS)

LOS is the direct path between transmitting and receiving antennas.

## Characteristics
*   **Frequency**: Dominant mode for VHF, UHF, and Microwave ($> 30 \text{ MHz}$).
*   **Limitation**: Blocked by terrain, buildings, and the curvature of the earth.

## Radio Horizon
Radio waves bend slightly over the horizon due to atmospheric refraction (density gradient of air).
*   **Optical Horizon**: Distance you can see with eyes.
*   **Radio Horizon**: $\approx \frac{4}{3} \times \text{Optical Horizon}$.
*   **Formula**: $d_{km} \approx 4.1 \times (\sqrt{h_{tx}} + \sqrt{h_{rx}})$
    *   $h$ in meters.
    *   Higher antennas = Further horizon.
