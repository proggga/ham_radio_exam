# Single Sideband (SSB)

SSB is a form of Amplitude Modulation where the Carrier and one Sideband are suppressed.

## Advantages
*   **Efficiency**: All transmitted power is useful information.
*   **Bandwidth**: Half that of AM (~2.4 - 2.7 kHz for voice).
    *   Allows more stations to fit in the band.

## Variants
*   **USB (Upper Sideband)**: Standard for frequencies > 10 MHz.
*   **LSB (Lower Sideband)**: Standard for frequencies < 10 MHz (40m, 80m).

## Reception
Requires a receiver with a **BFO** (Beat Frequency Oscillator) to re-insert the missing carrier for demodulation.
