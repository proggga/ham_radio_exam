# Emergency Signals

Emergency signals have absolute priority over all other communications.

## Telegraphy (CW)
*   **SOS**: `... --- ...` (Save Our Souls).
*   Sent as a single continuous sequence without spaces between letters.

## Telephony (Voice)
*   **MAYDAY**: From French "m'aidez" (help me).
*   Used only when there is grave and imminent danger to life or vessel.

## Amateur Radio Emergency Communication
In times of disaster, amateur radio operators may form emergency networks (e.g., ARES, RAYNET) to provide communications when standard infrastructure fails.

See [[Electrical Safety]] for personal safety guidelines.
