# Ground Wave Propagation (Grondgolf)

Ground wave propagation occurs when radio waves follow the curvature of the earth, hugging the surface.

## Characteristics
*   **Frequency Range**: Dominant at Low Frequencies (LF), Medium Frequencies (MF), and lower HF (160m/80m).
*   **Mechanism**: Diffraction and surface currents induced in the ground.
*   **Polarization**: **Vertical** polarization works best. Horizontal waves are shorted out by the conductive earth.

## Range
The range is determined by the earth's conductivity.
*   **Saltwater**: Excellent conductivity $\rightarrow$ Long range.
*   **Dry Sand/Rock**: Poor conductivity $\rightarrow$ Short range.
*   **Attenuation**: Increases rapidly with frequency. Above 3-5 MHz, ground wave range is negligible for DX.
