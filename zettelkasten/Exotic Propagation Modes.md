# Exotic Propagation Modes

Specialized modes often used by weak-signal enthusiasts on [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]]/[[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|UHF]].

## Types
*   **[[Special Propagation Modes|Aurora]]**: Reflection off ionized sheets at the magnetic poles during geomagnetic storms.
    *   *Effect*: Signals sound fluttery or "hissing". [[CW Abbreviations & Prosigns|CW]]/[[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]] only (Voice is distorted).
*   **[[Special Propagation Modes|Meteor Scatter]]**: Reflection off short-lived ionized trails left by meteors burning up in the atmosphere.
    *   *Effect*: Short bursts ("pings") of signal. Used with digital modes like MSK144.
*   **[[Earth-Moon-Earth (EME)|EME]] ([[Earth-Moon-Earth (EME)|Earth-Moon-Earth]])**: Bouncing signals off the moon.
    *   *Challenge*: Huge path loss (~250 [[Decibels & Logarithms|dB]]). Requires high power and large antennas.

## Related Notes
*   [[Ionospheric Layers]] ([[Special Propagation Modes|Sporadic E]] is another irregular mode)
*   [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)]]
