# Geometry & Trigonometry

Basic geometry is essential for understanding AC circuits, especially impedance.

## Pythagoras' Theorem
In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse ($c$) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ($a$ and $b$).
*   **Formula**: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
*   **Application**: In AC circuits, Resistance ($R$) and [[Reactance (Reactantie)|Reactance]] ($X$) are at right angles. The total [[Impedance (Impedantie)|Impedance]] ($Z$) is the hypotenuse:
    $Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}$

## Sine, Cosine, and Phase
AC signals are sinusoidal waves.
*   **Sine & Cosine**: Ratios of sides in a right-angled triangle relative to an angle.
*   **Phase**: The time relationship between two waves.
*   **Radians**: The natural unit for angles in physics. A full circle ($360^\circ$) is $2\pi$ radians.
    *   $\omega$ (Angular Frequency) $= 2\pi f$ (radians per second).
