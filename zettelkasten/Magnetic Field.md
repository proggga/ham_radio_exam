# Magnetic Field (Magnetisch Veld)

A magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic materials.

## Sources
1.  **Moving Charges**: Current flowing through a wire or [[Inductors (Spoelen)|Coil]].
2.  **Permanent Magnets**: Spin of electrons in atomic orbitals.

## Direction
*   **Right-Hand Grip Rule**: If you grip a wire with your right hand such that your thumb points in the direction of conventional current ($+$ to $-$), your fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines.

## Permeability ($\mu$)
The ability of a material to support the formation of a magnetic field within itself.
*   **Ferromagnetic materials**: (Iron, Nickel, Cobalt) have high permeability ($\mu_r \gg 1$). They concentrate magnetic flux.

## Shielding
*   Conductive materials (Copper/Aluminum) do **NOT** shield against static magnetic fields.
*   **Mu-metal** or Soft Iron (high permeability) is required to divert the magnetic flux lines around the protected area.
