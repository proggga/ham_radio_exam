# Map: Matching & SWR

This map covers the theory and practice of connecting transmitters to antennas.

## Concepts
*   [[Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)]] - The metric of mismatch.
*   [[Smith Chart]] - The tool for visualizing impedance.

## Equipment
*   [[Baluns]] - Matching Balanced to Unbalanced.
*   [[Antenna Tuning Unit (ATU)]] - Impedance matching device.

## Related
*   [[Transmission Lines]] - Where SWR exists.
*   [[Impedance Transformation]] - How lines transform impedance.
*   [[RF Measurements]] - Measuring SWR.
