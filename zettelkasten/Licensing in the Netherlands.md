# Licensing in the Netherlands

## 1. Registration
In the [[Operating Rules (Netherlands)|Netherlands]], you do not get a "license" (vergunning) but a **Registration**.
*   **Agency:** **RDI** (Rijksinspectie Digitale Infrastructuur), formerly Agentschap Telecom (AT). Part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
*   **Requirement:** Passing the exam (administered by CBR) allows you to register.
*   **Exam Levels:**
    *   **N (Novice):** Limited privileges (power, bands).
    *   **F (Full):** Full privileges (HAREC compliant).

## 2. Call Signs (Roepletters)
A unique identifier for the station.
*   **Structure:** Prefix + Suffix.
*   **[[SI Units & Prefixes|Prefixes]]:** Assigned to the Netherlands by [[Emission Classes (ITU)|ITU]] (PA-PI).
    *   **PA to PH:** Full License (F).
    *   **PD:** Novice License (N).
    *   **PI:** Special use (Repeaters, Beacons, Clubs, Events).
        *   *Example:* PI4... (Clubs), PI2.../PI3... (Repeaters).
*   **Suffix:** 1 to 3 letters.
    *   Prohibited: SOS, Q-codes (e.g., QRA-QUZ). See [[Rules & Procedures|Procedures]].

## 3. Operation
*   **Identification:** Must transmit call sign at the start, end, and every 10 minutes during a transmission.
*   **Supervision:** An N-licensee may operate an F-licensee's station (with higher power/other bands) ONLY if the F-licensee is physically present and supervising.
    *   The N-licensee must use the F-licensee's call sign (or their own /PA if agreed, but usually F-call under supervision).
*   **Unattended Operation:** Only allowed for specific automatic stations (beacons, digipeaters). A standard station cannot be left unattended if it can be triggered remotely or by family members unless specific safeguards are in place.
*   **Guest Operation (Visiting NL):**
    *   **Full License (CEPT T/R 61-01):** Visitors use prefix **PA/** followed by their home call (e.g., *PA/G4ABC*).
    *   **Novice License:** Visitors use prefix **PD/** followed by their home call (e.g., *PD/DO1ABC*).
*   **Operating Abroad:**
    *   With a Dutch registration (CEPT T/R 61-01), you can operate in many countries using their prefix before your call (e.g., DL/PA0ABC in Germany).
