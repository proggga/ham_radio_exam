# Directional Antennas (Beams)

Beam antennas focus energy in a specific direction, providing Gain.

## Yagi-Uda
A parasitic array consisting of:
1.  **Driven Element**: A dipole connected to the transmitter.
2.  **Reflector**: ~5% longer, placed behind the driven element. Reflects energy forward.
3.  **Director(s)**: ~5% shorter, placed in front. Focuses energy forward.

## Quad
Uses full-wave loops as elements instead of dipoles.
*   Typically has slightly higher gain than a Yagi of similar boom length.

## Characteristics
*   **Forward Gain**: Increases signal strength in the desired direction.
*   **Front-to-Back Ratio**: Rejects interference from the rear.
*   **Beamwidth**: The width of the main lobe (narrower beam = higher gain).
