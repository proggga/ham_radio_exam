# WARC Bands

The bands at 30m, 17m, and 12m were allocated at the World Administrative Radio Conference (1979).

## Special Rules
*   **NO Contesting:** By gentleman's agreement, these bands are contest-free zones. Great refuges on weekends.
*   **30m (10.1 MHz):** **[[CW Abbreviations & Prosigns|CW]] and Digital ONLY**. No Voice ([[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]]). Max 200W [[Analogue Modulation & AM|PEP]] in some regions.

## Characteristics
*   **30m (10.1 MHz):** Bridges 40m and 20m. Open 24/7 often.
*   **17m (18.1 MHz):** "The Hidden Gem". Bridges 20m and 15m. Great DX, less crowd.
*   **12m (24.9 MHz):** Like 10m but slightly more reliable. Solar cycle dependent.
