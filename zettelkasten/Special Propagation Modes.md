# Special Propagation Modes

Beyond standard Ground Wave and Sky Wave, several exotic propagation modes allow long-distance communication on [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]] and [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|UHF]] bands.

## 1. Sporadic E ($E_s$)
*   **Mechanism**: Patches of intense ionization in the E-layer of the [[The Ionosphere|ionosphere]].
*   **Bands**: Primarily **10m, 6m, and 2m**.
*   **Range**: 1,000 - 2,000 km (single hop).
*   **Characteristics**: Unpredictable (sporadic). Can be very strong. Most common in **Summer** (May-August) and minor peak in Winter (December).

## 2. Meteor Scatter
*   **Mechanism**: Reflections off the ionized trails left by meteors burning up in the atmosphere.
*   **Bands**: Best on **6m** and **2m**.
*   **Characteristics**: Short bursts of signals ("pings") lasting milliseconds to seconds.
*   **Technique**: High-speed digital modes (like **[[Modern Digital Modes|MSK144]]** in WSJT-X) are used to transmit information quickly during the burst.

## 3. Auroral Backscatter
*   **Mechanism**: Reflection off the curtain of ions in the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights).
*   **Characteristics**: Signals are fluttery and distorted ("whispery" or "raspy").
*   **Modes**: **[[CW Abbreviations & Prosigns|CW]]** is often the only usable mode due to distortion. [[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]] sounds robotic.
*   **Direction**: Point antennas **North** (in Northern Hemisphere).

## 4. Tropospheric Ducting
*   **Mechanism**: Temperature inversions in the atmosphere (warm air over cold air) trap radio waves in a "duct" along the surface.
*   **Bands**: [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]] and [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|UHF]].
*   **Range**: Can extend hundreds or thousands of kilometers (e.g., California to Hawaii).
*   **Indicators**: Stable high-pressure weather systems.
