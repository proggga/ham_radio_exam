# Transmitter Defects

Poorly designed or adjusted transmitters cause interference.

## Chirp (Tjoep)
A slight shift in frequency during CW keying.
*   **Cause**: Oscillator instability due to voltage sag or load changes when the transmitter is keyed.
*   **Sound**: A "yoop" sound instead of a pure tone. In Dutch often called "**Tjoep**".

## Key Clicks
Broadband sidebands generated by hard switching in CW.
*   **Cause**: Rise and fall times of the signal are too fast (square wave edges contain many harmonics).
*   **Sound**: Clicking heard across the band.

## Splatter
Broadband noise caused by overmodulation in AM/SSB.
*   **Cause**: Driving the Power Amplifier into saturation (clipping).
*   **Effect**: Signal becomes very wide, interfering with adjacent channels.
