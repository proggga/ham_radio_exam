# Map: Electric & Magnetic Fields

This map covers the fundamental fields of force in radio physics.

## The Fields
*   [[Electric Field]] - Created by Voltage ($).
*   [[Magnetic Field]] - Created by Current ($).

## The Combination
*   [[Electromagnetic Waves]] - The self-propagating wave used for radio.
    *   Covering Velocity, Wavelength, and Polarization.

## Components
*   [[Capacitor Principles]] - Stores Electric Field.
*   [[Inductors (Spoelen)]] - Stores Magnetic Field.
*   [[Antenna Characteristics]] - Radiates Electromagnetic Waves.
