# Map: Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic Fields

This map covers the fundamental fields of force in radio physics.

## 1. Electric Field (E-Field)
*   **Source:** Voltage (Potential Difference) between charges.
*   **Unit:** Volts per meter ($V/m$).
*   **Force:** Exerts force on electric charges.
*   **[[Shielding (Afscherming)|Shielding]]:** 
    *   Use **Conductive Material** (Copper, Aluminum).
    *   Faraday Cage effect.
    *   Ideally, the shield encloses both conductors.

## 2. Magnetic Field (H-Field)
*   **Source:** Current flowing through a conductor.
*   **Lines:** Concentric circles around the wire (Right-Hand Rule).
    *   Current moving away ($\times$): Field Clockwise.
    *   Current moving towards ($\cdot$): Field Counter-Clockwise.
*   **[[Shielding (Afscherming)|Shielding]]:** 
    *   Conductive materials (Al, Cu) do **NOT** shield static magnetic fields effectively.
    *   Use **High Permeability Material** (Soft Iron, Mu-Metal) to guide magnetic flux lines around the protected area.

## 3. Electromagnetic Field
*   **Combination:** E-field and H-field oscillating at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation.
*   **Ratio:** $E / H = 377 \Omega$ ([[Impedance (Impedantie)|Impedance]] of Free Space).
*   [[Inductors (Spoelen)]] - Stores [[Magnetic Field]].
*   [[Antenna Characteristics]] - Radiates [[Electromagnetic Waves]].

## Components
*   [[Capacitor Principles]] - Stores [[Electric Field]].
