# Conductors and Insulators

The ability of a material to conduct electricity depends on the behavior of electrons in the outermost shell (valence shell) of its atoms.

## Conductors (Geleiders)
Materials where outer electrons are **loosely bound** to the nucleus.
*   **Mechanism:** These "free electrons" can easily move from atom to atom when a voltage is applied.
*   **Examples:** Most metals (Silver, Copper, Gold, Aluminum).
*   **Use:** Wiring, traces on PCBs, antennas.

## Insulators (Isolatoren)
Materials where electrons are **tightly bound** to the nucleus.
*   **Mechanism:** Electrons cannot move freely, preventing current flow (up to a breakdown voltage).
*   **Examples:** Glass, Plastic, Rubber, Air, Ceramic, Teflon.
*   **Use:** Wire sheathing, capacitor dielectrics, antenna spacers.

## Semiconductors (Halfgeleiders)
Materials with conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator.
*   **Examples:** Silicon, Germanium.
*   **Note:** Their conductivity can be modified by "doping" (see [[Semiconductors]]).

> **Note:** There is no perfect conductor (except superconductors at very low temperatures) and no perfect insulator (breakdown occurs at high voltages).
