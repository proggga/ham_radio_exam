# Coaxial Cable & Connectors

Coaxial cable (Coax) is the most common feed line for amateur radio because it is easy to use and requires few special installation considerations.

## Cable Types
Most amateur radio coax has a characteristic [[Impedance (Impedantie)|Impedance]] of **50 Ohms**.

### Common Types
*   **RG-58**: Thin, flexible. High loss at [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]]/[[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|UHF]]. Good for short [[Propagation Basics|HF]] runs or mobile installations.
*   **RG-213 / RG-8**: Thicker, heavier. **Lower loss** than RG-58. Better for long runs and higher power.
*   **Hardline**: Air-insulated or foam with a solid shield. Lowest loss, used for repeaters and [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]]/[[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|UHF]].

### Loss Characteristics
*   **Frequency**: Loss **increases** as frequency increases. (RG-58 is acceptable for 80m, but poor for 440 MHz).
*   **Length**: Loss is proportional to length. Keep feed lines as short as possible.
*   **[[Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)|SWR]]**: High [[Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)|SWR]] increases loss (power is lost as heat).

## Failure Modes
*   **Moisture**: The #1 cause of coax failure. Water intrusion increases loss and changes impedance.
*   **UV Damage**: Ultraviolet light cracks the outer jacket, allowing water to enter. Use UV-resistant cables (usually black).
*   **Contamination**: Solder flux or dirt in connectors.

## Connectors

### PL-259 (UHF Connector)
*   **Use**: Standard for [[Propagation Basics|HF]] and VHF.
*   **Limitation**: Not watertight. Not constant impedance. High loss above 400 MHz.

### Type N
*   **Use**: Preferred for **UHF (440 MHz+)** and microwaves.
*   **Features**: Constant impedance, moisture-resistant (if properly installed), lower loss at high frequencies.

### Installation
*   Erratic [[Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)|SWR]] is often caused by loose connections or bad solder joints in connectors.
*   Always waterproof outdoor connections.
