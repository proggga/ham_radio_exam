# Amateur Radio Activities

Amateur radio is a versatile hobby with many different aspects, allowing operators to specialize in areas that interest them most.

## Key Activities

*   **Homebrew & Experimentation**: The technical side of the hobby involving designing and building radios, antennas, and accessories.
*   **DXing**: The pursuit of contacts with distant or rare stations ("DX"). This often involves tracking solar conditions and using efficient antennas. See [[The Ionosphere]].
*   **Contesting**: Competitive operating where the goal is to make as many contacts as possible within a set time.
    *   *Exchange:* Operators typically exchange specific information like **RST** + **Serial Number** or **Grid Locator**.
*   **Field Days**: Operating portable stations from temporary locations (e.g., open fields) to practice emergency readiness and enjoy low-noise reception away from urban QRM.
*   **Fox Hunting (Vossenjacht)**: A sport involving finding hidden transmitters using direction-finding equipment. See [[Radio Direction Finding (RDF)]].

## Grid Locators (Maidenhead)
A geographic coordinate system used by radio amateurs to succinctly describe their location.
*   **Format**: Pairs of letters and numbers (e.g., **JO22** or **JO22eb**).
    *   **Field**: 2 Letters (e.g., **JO**). Covers large area.
    *   **Square**: 2 Digits (e.g., **22**). $1^\circ$ Latitude by $2^\circ$ Longitude.
    *   **Subsquare**: 2 Letters (e.g., **eb**). More precise.
*   **Usage**: Essential for [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]]/UHF contesting and determining distance/bearing.

## Listening
You don't need a transmitter to participate. **WebSDR** sites (like the University of Twente's receiver) allow anyone to listen to amateur bands via a web browser. This is an excellent way to become familiar with [[Standard QSO Procedure]].
