# Amateur Radio Activities

Amateur radio is a versatile hobby with many different aspects, allowing operators to specialize in areas that interest them most.

## Key Activities

*   **Homebrew & Experimentation**: The technical side of the hobby involving designing and building radios, antennas, and accessories.
*   **DXing**: The pursuit of contacts with distant or rare stations ("DX"). This often involves tracking solar conditions and using efficient antennas. See [[The Ionosphere]].
*   **Contesting**: Competitive operating where the goal is to make as many contacts as possible within a set time. Operators often exchange specific codes (like RST + Serial Number) rather than chatting.
*   **Field Days**: Operating portable stations from temporary locations (e.g., open fields) to practice emergency readiness and enjoy low-noise reception away from urban QRM.
*   **Fox Hunting (Vossenjacht)**: A sport involving finding hidden transmitters using direction-finding equipment and triangulation techniques.

## Listening
You don't need a transmitter to participate. **WebSDR** sites (like the University of Twente's receiver) allow anyone to listen to amateur bands via a web browser. This is an excellent way to become familiar with [[Standard QSO Procedure]].
