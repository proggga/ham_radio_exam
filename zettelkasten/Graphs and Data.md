# Graphs and Data

Radio exams often require interpreting graphs to understand circuit behavior (like filter response) or propagation conditions.

## Axes
*   **X-axis (Horizontal)**: Typically the independent variable (e.g., Frequency or Time).
*   **Y-axis (Vertical)**: Typically the dependent variable (e.g., Voltage, Current, or Gain).

## Scales
*   **Linear Scale**: Equal distances represent equal additions (1, 2, 3, 4). Used when values are in a relatively small range.
*   **Logarithmic Scale**: Equal distances represent equal multiplications (1, 10, 100, 1000). Essential in radio for plotting **Frequency** (spanning Hz to GHz) or **Gain** (in [[Decibels & Logarithms|dB]]).
