# RMS Voltage

The **Effective Value** or **RMS** (Root Mean Square) is the most common way to express AC voltage.

## Definition
The RMS value of an AC sine wave is equivalent to the DC voltage that would produce the **same amount of heat** in a resistor.

## Formulas (Sine Wave)
*   **RMS**: $U_{eff} = \frac{U_{max}}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707 \times U_{max}$
*   **Peak**: $U_{max} = U_{eff} \times \sqrt{2} \approx 1.41 \times U_{eff}$

## Example
*   Mains voltage is typically **230V RMS**.
*   The Peak voltage is $230 \times 1.41 \approx 325V$.

## Average Value
*   Over a full cycle, the average is **0**.
*   Over a half cycle (rectified): $U_{avg} \approx 0.637 \times U_{max}$.
