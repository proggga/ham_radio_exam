# Sky Wave Propagation (Ruimtegolf)

Sky wave is the primary mode for long-distance (DX) communication on HF.

## Mechanism
Radio waves radiate upward and are refracted (bent) back to earth by the ionized layers of the atmosphere.
*   **Reflector**: The [[Ionospheric Layers]] (specifically E and F layers).
*   **Frequency**: 3-30 MHz (HF).

## Geometry
*   **Critical Angle**: The steepest angle of radiation at which a wave will still be reflected. Waves sent at angles *steeper* than the critical angle punch through into space.
*   **Skip Distance**: The distance along the ground from the transmitter to where the first reflected wave lands.
*   **Skip Zone (Dead Zone)**: The area between the end of Ground Wave coverage and the start of Sky Wave coverage. Signals are skipped over this area.
    *   *Solution:* Use [[Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS)]] to fill this gap.
*   **Multi-hop**: Signals can bounce off the earth and the ionosphere multiple times to reach the other side of the globe.
