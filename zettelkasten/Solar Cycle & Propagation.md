# Solar Cycle & Propagation

The ionosphere is created by solar radiation (UV and X-rays). Its density follows the sun's activity.

## The Solar Cycle
*   **Duration**: Approximately **11 years**.
*   **Sunspots (Zonnevlekken)**: Dark spots on the sun indicating magnetic activity. More sunspots = More ionizing radiation.
*   **Solar Flux Index (SFI)**: A measurement of solar radio noise (10.7cm), correlating with ionization.

## Impact on Bands
*   **Solar Maximum (High Flux)**:
    *   High ionization density in F-layers.
    *   **High Bands (10m, 12m, 15m)**: Open worldwide. Reflect well.
*   **Solar Minimum (Low Flux)**:
    *   Low ionization.
    *   High frequencies pass through the ionosphere into space.
    *   DX is limited to **Lower Bands (20m, 40m, 80m)**.
