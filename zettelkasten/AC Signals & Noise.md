# AC Signals & Noise

This map covers the behavior of Alternating Current (AC) and noise signals.

## AC Theory
*   **[[AC Signal Parameters]]** - Frequency, Period, Amplitude, Phase.
*   **[[RMS Voltage]]** - Effective value ({eff}$).
*   **[[Complex Waveforms & Fourier]]** - Square/Triangle waves and Harmonics (Fourier).

## Noise
*   **[[Noise Types]]** - Thermal, Shot, and Atmospheric noise.

## Related
*   **[[Voltage, Current, and Ohm's Law]]** - DC fundamentals.
*   **[[Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic Fields]]** - Propagation of AC as radio waves.
