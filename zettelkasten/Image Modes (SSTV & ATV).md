# Image Modes (SSTV & ATV)

Amateur radio operators can transmit still pictures and real-time video using specialized modes.

## 1. SSTV (Slow Scan Television)
SSTV is used to transmit **still images** (like a fax) over voice-bandwidth channels.
*   **Bandwidth**: Fits within a standard 3 kHz [[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]] or [[Frequency Modulation (FM)|FM]] voice channel.
*   **Transmission Time**: Takes 8 to 120 seconds to send one image (depending on the mode/resolution).
*   **Technology**: Audio tones vary in frequency to represent brightness and color (FM subcarrier).
*   **Frequencies**: Popular on [[20m Band]] (14.230 MHz) and [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|2m]] FM (145.800 MHz from the **ISS**).
*   **Software**: MMSSTV, QSSTV.

## 2. ATV (Amateur Television)
ATV involves transmitting **real-time video** and audio (like broadcast TV).
*   **Fast-Scan TV (FSTV)**:
    *   **Bandwidth**: Very wide (6 MHz), similar to old analog broadcast TV (NTSC/PAL).
    *   **Bands**: Restricted to **70cm (420 MHz)** and higher frequencies because of the bandwidth requirement.
*   **Digital ATV (DATV)**: Uses digital encoding (DVB-S/DVB-T) for better quality and efficiency.

## Regulations
*   **Indecency**: Transmitting obscene or indecent images is strictly prohibited.
*   **Identification**: You must identify your station (voice or CW) periodically, even if the image contains your callsign.
