# Call Signs

A call sign is the unique identifier for an amateur radio station.

## Structure
A standard amateur call sign consists of:
1.  **Prefix**: Indicates the country (e.g., PA, K, G, JA).
2.  **Number**: Usually indicates a region or license class (e.g., 0-9).
3.  **Suffix**: Unique identifier for the station (1-3 letters).

    *   **PD**: Novice License (N-Registration).
    *   **PI**: Special use (Repeaters, Beacons, Clubs, Educational).
*   **Suffix**: Typically 1 to 3 letters.

## Operating Abroad / Special Conditions
*   **Visitor**: When operating in another country (under CEPT/HAREC), the host country's prefix is often prepended (e.g., `DL/PA0ABC`).
*   **Portable**: `/P` (Portable) - Operating away from the home station.
*   **Mobile**: `/M` (Mobile) - Operating from a vehicle.
*   **Maritime Mobile**: `/MM` - Operating from a vessel at sea.
