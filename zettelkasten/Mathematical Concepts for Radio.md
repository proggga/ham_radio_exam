# Mathematical Concepts for Radio

Radio engineering relies on several key mathematical tools.

## Scientific Notation
Numbers are often written as a value between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10. This makes handling very large or very small numbers easier.
*   $275,000,000 = 2.75 \times 10^8$
*   $0.000000275 = 2.75 \times 10^{-7}$

## Rearranging Formulas
You must be comfortable manipulating equations.
Example: [[Voltage, Current, and Ohm's Law|Ohm's Law]] $U = I \times R$
*   To find $I$: divide both sides by $R \rightarrow I = U / R$
*   To find $R$: divide both sides by $I \rightarrow R = U / I$

## Percentages
A percentage (%) is a fraction of 100. In radio, it is often used to calculate **Efficiency** (Rendement).

**Formula**: $\text{Efficiency} = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} \times 100\%$

*Example*: If a transmitter consumes 100 Watts ($P_{in}$) to produce 60 Watts of RF ($P_{out}$):
$\frac{60}{100} \times 100\% = 60\%$ efficiency.
