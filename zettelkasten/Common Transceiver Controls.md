# Common Transceiver Controls

Understanding transceiver controls is essential for proper operation and signal quality.

## Transmitter Controls
*   **Microphone Gain (Mic Gain)**: Controls the audio level sent to the transmitter.
    *   *Excessive Gain:* Causes **distortion** and splattering (over-deviation in FM, flat-topping/splatter in SSB).
*   **Power Output**: Adjustable power level. Use the minimum power necessary to maintain contact.
*   **VOX (Voice Operated Exchange)**: Automatically switches to transmit when you speak.
    *   *Anti-VOX:* Prevents speaker audio from tripping the VOX.
*   **PTT (Push-to-Talk)**: Manual switch to transmit.

## Receiver Controls
*   **VFO (Variable Frequency Oscillator)**: The main tuning dial used to select frequency.
*   **Volume (AF Gain)**: Controls audio loudness.
*   **Squelch**: Mutes the audio when no signal is present.
    *   *Adjustment:* Set just above the noise threshold.
    *   *Too High:* Weak signals are blocked.
    *   *Too Low:* Constant static noise.
*   **RIT / Clarifier (Receiver Incremental Tuning)**: Changes the *receive* frequency without changing the *transmit* frequency.
    *   *Use:* To tune in a station that is slightly off-frequency (e.g., voice sounds like Donald Duck in SSB) without shifting your own transmit frequency.
*   **RF Gain**: Adjusts the sensitivity of the receiver's RF amplifier stage. Reducing it can help with strong local signals.
*   **AGC (Automatic Gain Control)**: Automatically adjusts gain to keep audio volume constant despite fading.
    *   *Settings:* Fast (CW), Slow (SSB), Off.

## Function Controls
*   **Memory**: Stores frequencies for quick recall.
*   **Scan**: Automatically searches a range of frequencies or memory channels for activity.
*   **Split**: Operates with different Transmit and Receive frequencies (essential for working DX pileups or Repeaters).
*   **Repeater Offset**: The frequency difference between input and output (e.g., 600 kHz on 2m).
*   **Tone / CTCSS**: Selects the sub-audible tone required to access repeaters.
