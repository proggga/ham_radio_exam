# Common Transceiver Controls

Understanding transceiver controls is essential for proper operation and signal quality.

## Transmitter Controls
*   **[[Station Accessories|Microphone]] Gain (Mic Gain)**: Controls the audio level sent to the transmitter.
    *   *Excessive Gain:* Causes **distortion** and splattering (over-deviation in [[Frequency Modulation (FM)|FM]], flat-topping/splatter in [[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]]).
*   **Power Output**: Adjustable power level. Use the minimum power necessary to maintain contact.
*   **VOX (Voice Operated Exchange)**: Automatically switches to transmit when you speak.
    *   *Anti-VOX:* Prevents speaker audio from tripping the VOX.
*   **PTT (Push-to-Talk)**: Manual switch to transmit.

## Receiver Controls
*   **VFO (Variable Frequency Oscillator)**: The main tuning dial used to select frequency.
*   **Volume (AF Gain)**: Controls audio loudness.
*   **Squelch**: Mutes the audio when no signal is present.
    *   *Adjustment:* Set just above the noise threshold.
    *   *Too High:* Weak signals are blocked.
    *   *Too Low:* Constant static noise.
*   **RIT / Clarifier (Receiver Incremental Tuning)**: Changes the *receive* frequency without changing the *transmit* frequency.
    *   *Use:* To tune in a station that is slightly off-frequency (e.g., voice sounds like Donald Duck in [[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]]) without shifting your own transmit frequency.
*   **RF Gain**: Adjusts the sensitivity of the receiver's RF amplifier stage. Reducing it can help with strong local signals.
*   **[[Automatic Gain Control (AGC)|AGC]] ([[Automatic Gain Control (AGC)|Automatic Gain Control]])**: Automatically adjusts gain to keep audio volume constant despite fading.
    *   *Settings:* Fast ([[CW Abbreviations & Prosigns|CW]]), Slow ([[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]]), Off.

## Function Controls
*   **Memory**: Stores frequencies for quick recall.
*   **Scan**: Automatically searches a range of frequencies or memory channels for activity.
*   **Split**: Operates with different Transmit and Receive frequencies (essential for working DX pileups or Repeaters).
*   **[[Repeater Operation|Repeater]] [[Repeater Operation|Offset]]**: The frequency difference between input and output (e.g., 600 kHz on 2m).
*   **Tone / [[Repeater Operation|CTCSS]]**: Selects the sub-audible tone required to access repeaters.
