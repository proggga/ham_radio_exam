# Resonance

Resonance occurs in an LC circuit (Inductor + Capacitor) when Inductive Reactance equals Capacitive Reactance ($X_L = X_C$).

## Resonant Frequency ($f_{res}$)
Calculated using the **Thomson Formula**:
$$f_{res} = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{L \cdot C}}$$

## Series Resonance
*   **Impedance**: Minimal ($Z = R_{loss} \approx 0$).
*   **Behavior**: Acts as a **short circuit** at resonance.
*   **Application**: Suction circuit (Zuigkring) to shunt interference to ground.

## Parallel Resonance
*   **Impedance**: Maximal ($Z$ is very high).
*   **Behavior**: Acts as an **open circuit** at resonance.
*   **Application**: Tuned circuit (Kring), Trap (Sperkring).
