# Crystals (Quartz)

Crystals are components made of quartz that vibrate at a precise frequency due to the **Piezoelectric effect**.

## Function
*   **Stability**: Provides very high frequency stability for oscillators and filters compared to LC circuits.
*   **Q-Factor**: Extremely high Q (Quality Factor), resulting in sharp resonance.

## Types
*   **AT-cut**: The standard cut for good temperature stability over a wide range.
*   **TCXO (Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator)**: Contains a circuit that compensates for frequency drift due to temperature changes.
*   **OCXO (Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator)**: The crystal is kept in a heated chamber (oven) at a constant temperature. Highest stability, but consumes more power.
