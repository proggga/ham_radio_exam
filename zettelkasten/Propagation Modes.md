# Map: Propagation Modes

This map covers the different paths radio waves take to travel from transmitter to receiver.

## Standard Modes
*   [[Ground Wave Propagation]] - LF/MF, following the surface.
*   [[Sky Wave Propagation]] - [[Propagation Basics|HF]], skipping off the ionosphere.
*   [[Line of Sight Propagation (LOS)]] - [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]]/UHF, direct path.

## Extended VHF/UHF Modes
*   [[Tropospheric Propagation]] - Ducting and scattering due to weather.
*   [[Exotic Propagation Modes]] - Aurora, Meteor Scatter, EME.

## Related
