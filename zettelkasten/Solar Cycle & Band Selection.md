# Solar Cycle & Band Selection

The **11-year solar cycle** fundamentally determines which HF bands are usable for long-distance communication (DX).

## Mechanism
*   **Solar Flux Index (SFI) / Sunspot Number (SSN):** Indicators of ionization levels in the atmosphere.
*   **Higher Solar Activity:** Increases ionization density in the **F-Layers**.
    *   **Result:** Higher frequencies (MUF rises) are reflected back to earth instead of passing through to space.
    *   **Bands:** 10m, 12m, 15m (and 6m) open up for worldwide DX.
*   **Lower Solar Activity:** Lower ionization density.
    *   **Result:** MUF drops. Higher bands go "dead".
    *   **Bands:** Focus shifts to lower bands (160m, 80m, 40m) which rely less on intense ionization or work better at night.

## Strategy by Phase

### Solar Minimum (SSN < 20)
*   **Best Bands:** 160m, 80m, 40m.
*   **Daytime:** 20m may open briefly.
*   **Night:** Lower bands are prime for DX.
*   **Higher Bands:** Mostly dead (except for sporadic E on 10m/6m).

### Moderate Activity (SSN 50-100)
*   **Workhorses:** 40m and 20m are reliable.
*   **Daylight:** 17m and 15m open on North-South paths or mid-day.
*   **Strategy:** Check 15m/17m during the day; switch to 40m/20m at night.

### Solar Maximum (SSN > 150)
*   **Best Bands:** 10m, 12m, 15m, 20m.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   10m can be open worldwide with low power.
    *   20m can stay open all night.
    *   6m F2 openings possible.
*   **Downside:** Lower bands (160/80m) may be noisier.
