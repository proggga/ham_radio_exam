# Map: Power & Energy

This map covers the concepts of work and power in electrical systems.

## Fundamentals
*   [[Electrical Power]] - Rate of work (=UI$).
*   [[Electrical Energy]] - Total work over time (=Pt$).

## Practical Application
*   [[Electrical Dissipation]] - Heat loss and power ratings.

## Related
*   [[Voltage, Current, and Ohm's Law]] - Foundation formulas.
*   [[Power Amplifiers and Matching]] - Handling high power.
