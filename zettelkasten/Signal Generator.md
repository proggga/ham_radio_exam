A Signal Generator produces stable RF signals for testing and aligning receivers.

## Features
*   **Precise Frequency**: Stable and adjustable.
*   **Accurate Attenuation**: Can output very low levels (e.g., $-100 dBm$ or microvolts) to test receiver sensitivity.
*   **Modulation**: Can add AM, FM, or CW modulation to the carrier.
