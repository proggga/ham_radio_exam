# Physics Principles

Two fundamental principles of physics apply to all electronics and radio systems.

## Conservation of Energy
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
*   In a transmitter, electrical energy from the power supply is transformed into radio frequency (RF) energy and heat.
*   $Energy_{in} = Energy_{useful} + Energy_{waste}$

## Entropy & Heat
Order naturally tends toward disorder. In practical terms, no system is 100% efficient.
*   Some energy is always lost as heat due to resistance and other inefficiencies.
*   This is why high-power transmitters require heat sinks and cooling fans.
