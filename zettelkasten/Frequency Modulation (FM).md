# Frequency Modulation (FM)

FM conveys information by varying the frequency of the carrier.

## Parameters
*   **Deviation ($\Delta f$)**: The maximum frequency shift from the center frequency.
*   **Modulation Index**: $m = \Delta f / f_{mod}$.

## Bandwidth (Carson's Rule)
$$B \approx 2(\Delta f + f_{max\_audio})$$
FM bandwidth is generally wider than AM or SSB.

## Characteristics
*   **Noise Immunity**: FM receivers limit amplitude variations (static), resulting in quiet backgrounds.
*   **Capture Effect**: The receiver locks onto the strongest signal, completely suppressing weaker signals on the same frequency.
