# Hidden and Limited-Space Antennas

When full-size antennas are not feasible due to space or zoning restrictions (HOA), hidden or compromise antennas allow operation.

## Attic Antennas
Antennas installed completely inside the roof space.
*   **Constrained [[The Dipole Antenna|Dipole]]**: A dipole bent to fit the space.
    *   *Configuration:* Arms can be bent (V-shape) or ends folded.
    *   *Effect:* [[Impedance (Impedantie)|Impedance]] deviates from 73$\Omega$, requiring a tuner. Pattern is distorted.
    *   *[[Electrical Safety|Safety]]:* Use insulated wire mounted on standoffs to prevent fire hazards from high voltage RF arcing (Corona).
*   **Non-Resonant Loop**: A large wire loop run around the perimeter of the attic.
    *   *Feed:* Fed with parallel line (ladder line) to a balanced tuner.
    *   *Pattern:* Roughly bidirectional (vertical loop) or omnidirectional (horizontal loop).

## Flagpole Antenna
A vertical antenna disguised as a flagpole.
*   **Construction**: Thick-walled white PVC plumbing pipe serves as the pole.
*   **Radiator**:
    *   **Wire**: A wire runs inside the pipe.
    *   **Tubing**: Aluminum tubing hidden inside the PVC.
*   **Tuning**: Often requires a tuner at the base (L-network) or a remote tuner, as the length is rarely exactly resonant for the desired bands.
*   **Radials**: Requires a ground system or counterpoise buried in the grass.

## Other Limited-Space Options
*   **Slanted [[The Dipole Antenna|Dipole]] (Slipole)**: One end high on the house, the other anchored near the ground (keep out of reach for safety).
*   **Vee Dipole**: Elements arranged in a V shape (angle > 90°, < 180°). Saves horizontal space.
*   **Window-Sill [[Antenna & Tower Safety|Antenna]]**: A short metal rod or mobile whip clamped to a window sill. Requires a good counterpoise (e.g., metal window frame or wire) to work.
*   **Mobile Antennas**: High-efficiency mobile [[Propagation Basics|HF]] antennas (e.g., Hamsticks, Screwdrivers) can be mounted on a balcony railing or metal sheet.
