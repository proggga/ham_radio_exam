# Standard QSO Procedure

A standard contact (QSO) in amateur radio typically follows a structured format to ensure efficient communication.

## The Sequence

1.  **Calling CQ**: A general call inviting anyone to reply.
    *   Voice: "CQ CQ CQ this is PA0ABC..."
    *   CW: "CQ CQ CQ DE PA0ABC K"
2.  **The Exchange**: Once contact is established, operators exchange essential information:
    *   **Signal Report (RST)**: Readability, Strength, and Tone.
    *   **Name & QTH**: The operator's name and location. The location is often given as a **Maidenhead Grid Locator** (e.g., JO22).
3.  **Closing**: The contact ends with "73" (Best Regards).

## Signal Reporting (RST)

The RST system is used to describe signal quality:

*   **R (Readability)**: 1 to 5 scale.
    *   1 = Unreadable
    *   5 = Perfectly readable
*   **S (Strength)**: 1 to 9 scale.
    *   1 = Faint signal
    *   9 = Very strong signal
    *   Signals stronger than S9 are reported as "S9 plus dB" (e.g., "59 + 20dB").
*   **T (Tone)**: 1 to 9 scale (CW only).
    *   1 = Very rough, broad AC note
    *   9 = Perfect sine wave

## QSL Cards
A **QSL card** is a written confirmation of a radio contact.
*   **Physical Cards**: Often sent via a **QSL Bureau** or direct mail.
*   **Digital**: Services like **Logbook of the World (LoTW)** or **eQSL** provide electronic confirmation.
