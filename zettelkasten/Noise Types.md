# Noise Types

[[AC Signals & Noise|Noise]] (Ruis) sets the fundamental limit on receiver sensitivity.

## Thermal Noise
Generated by thermal agitation of electrons in any conductor or resistor.
*   **Formula**: $P_n = k \cdot T \cdot B$
    *   $k$ = Boltzmann's constant ($1.38 \times 10^{-23} J/K$).
    *   $T$ = Temperature (Kelvin).
    *   $B$ = [[Bandwidth]] (Hz).
*   **Implication**: Wider bandwidth = More noise. Cooling the receiver reduces noise.

## Shot Noise
Random fluctuations in current across semiconductor junctions (diodes/transistors).

## External Noise
*   **QRN**: Natural/Atmospheric noise (Static, Lightning). Dominant on [[Propagation Basics|HF]] bands.
*   **QRM**: Man-made interference.
*   **Galactic [[AC Signals & Noise|Noise]]**: From the galaxy (dominant on [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]]/[[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|UHF]] when looking at the sky).
