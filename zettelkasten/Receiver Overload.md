# Receiver Overload

Receiver overload occurs when a very strong signal (even if off-frequency) enters the RF front-end of a receiver.

## Blocking (Blokkering)
*   **Effect**: The receiver goes "deaf" (desensitized) or the gain fluctuates wildly.
*   **Mechanism**: The input transistor/FET is driven into saturation or cutoff by the high voltage of the strong signal.
*   **Mitigation**: Use an attenuator or a better preselector filter.
