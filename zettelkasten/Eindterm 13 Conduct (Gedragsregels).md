# Eindterm 13: Conduct (Gedragsregels)

## Social Responsibility
Amateur radio operators are privileged to use a wide range of frequencies and high power levels. With this freedom comes the responsibility to prevent chaos on the airwaves. Operators must:
*   **Self-Regulate:** Strictly adhere to international and local regulations.
*   **Prevent Interference:** Ensure equipment is technically sound and operated correctly to avoid disrupting other services (military, aviation, emergency) or fellow amateurs. See [[Types of Interference|Interference]].
*   **Be Polite:** The "Ham Spirit" emphasizes helpfulness, tolerance, and politeness. Rudeness or selfish behavior has no place on the bands.

## Good Operator Practice
Before pressing the PTT (Push-to-Talk) button, always **listen first** to ensure the frequency is not in use. When transmitting, use the **minimum power necessary** to maintain a contact. This reduces the chance of interference and saves energy.

## Emergency Communications
In times of disaster, amateur radio often serves as a resilient backup when commercial infrastructure fails.
*   **DARES:** In the Netherlands, the *Dutch Amateur Radio Emergency Service* coordinates these efforts.
*   **Emergency Signals:**
    *   **MAYDAY:** Used only when there is an immediate threat to life or vessel.
    *   **PAN PAN:** Indicates an urgent situation that is not yet life-threatening.
