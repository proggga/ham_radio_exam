# Soldering & Connections

Reliable electrical connections are the foundation of a working radio station. Soldering is the process of joining metals using a filler metal (solder) with a lower melting point.

## Solder Types
*   **Rosin-Core**: The standard for electronics. The flux (rosin) cleans oxides from the metal during heating.
*   **Acid-Core**: **NEVER** use for electronics. It causes corrosion. Only for plumbing.
*   **Lead-Free (Sn/Cu/Ag)**: Modern standard (RoHS). Higher melting point than leaded solder.
*   **Leaded (Sn/Pb 60/40)**: Easier to work with (lower melting point), but poses health risks (wash hands).

## The Perfect Joint
1.  **Mechanical Strength**: The wire should be mechanically secure before soldering.
2.  **Appearance**:
    *   **Good**: Shiny (for leaded) or smooth satin (for lead-free), concave fillet (meniscus).
    *   **Bad ("Cold" Joint)**: Dull, grainy, rough, or lumpy. Caused by insufficient heat or moving the joint while cooling. High resistance or intermittent connection.

## Technique
1.  **Heat the Work**: Apply the iron tip to the *parts* (wire and pad), not just the solder.
2.  **Apply Solder**: Feed solder into the joint, not the iron.
3.  **Clean**: Keep the iron tip tinned (shiny) and clean.

## Connectors
*   **Crimping**: Often superior to soldering for coaxial connectors (PL-259, BNC) and power lugs (Anderson Powerpoles) if the correct ratcheting tool is used.
*   **Waterproofing**: Outdoor connections must be sealed with:
    1.  Electrical Tape.
    2.  **Self-Amalgamating Tape** (Rubber splicing tape).
    3.  Final layer of Electrical Tape (UV protection).
