# VHF/UHF Bands

Bands above 30 MHz behave differently from [[Propagation Basics|HF]], relying primarily on Line-of-Sight rather than ionospheric skip.

## 6m Band (50 MHz) - "The Magic Band"
*   **Nature:** Hybrid between HF and VHF.
*   **Modes:**
    *   **Sporadic E:** Common in summer.
    *   **F2 DX:** Only at peak Solar Max.
    *   **Meteor Scatter / Aurora:** Exotic modes.

## 2m Band (144 MHz)
*   **Primary Use:** Local [[Frequency Modulation (FM)|FM]] Repeaters, Emergency Comms, Packet/APRS.
*   **Range:** Line of Sight (30-100 miles).
*   **DX:** Tropospheric Ducting (can go hundreds of miles), [[Single Sideband (SSB)|SSB]]/[[CW Abbreviations & Prosigns|CW]] weak signal work.
*   **Antennas:** Very small (~1m / 3ft).

## 70cm Band (430 MHz)
*   **Primary Use:** Urban comms (penetrates buildings well), Satellite uplinks, Fast Scan TV.
*   **[[AC Signals & Noise|Noise]]:** Lowest noise floor (S0).
*   **Range:** Strictly line of sight, but Tropospheric ducting can be very strong.
