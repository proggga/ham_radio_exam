# Emergency Operations

Amateur radio often serves as a backup communication system during disasters when standard infrastructure (phones, internet) fails.

## Net Operations
A "Net" (Network) is a gathering of stations on a specific frequency at a specific time.

### Net Control Station (NCS)
The station in charge of the net.
*   **Duties**: Calls the net to order, directs traffic, and manages the frequency.
*   **Procedure**: Stations must ask permission from the NCS before transmitting ("Directing traffic").

### Types of Nets
1.  **Directed Net**: Strict control. Stations only speak when spoken to by NCS. Used during emergencies or high-volume traffic.
2.  **Open/Free Net**: Casual. Stations can talk to each other directly.

## Traffic Handling
The passing of formal messages (radiograms) between stations.
*   **Preamble**: Header information (Message number, precedence, station of origin, check).
    *   *Check:* The count of words in the text body. Used to verify accuracy.
*   **Phonetics**: Use the [[Phonetic Alphabet]] for difficult words.
*   **Prosigns**: Use [[CW Abbreviations & Prosigns]] to manage flow (e.g., "BREAK" to interrupt for urgent traffic).

## Emergency Declarations
*   **Priority**: Emergency traffic *always* has priority over routine traffic.
*   **Tactical Call Signs**: Using functional names (e.g., "Shelter 1", "Command Post") instead of personal call signs to simplify coordination (though legal ID is still required).

## Organizations
*   **ARES (US)**: Amateur Radio Emergency Service.
*   **RACES (US)**: Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (Civil Defense).
*   **DARES (NL)**: Dutch Amateur Radio Emergency Service.
