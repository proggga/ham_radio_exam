# Map: Circuits & Kirchhoff's Laws

This map covers the fundamental rules for analyzing electrical circuits.

## Core Laws
*   [[Kirchhoff's Laws]] - Conservation of Current (KCL) and Voltage (KVL).
*   [[Voltage, Current, and Ohm's Law]] - The relationship  = I \times R$.

## Circuit Topologies
*   [[Series Circuits]] - Components in a chain (Voltage divides).
*   [[Parallel Circuits]] - Components side-by-side (Current divides).
*   [[Voltage Dividers]] - Practical application of series circuits for setting levels.

## Analysis Tools
*   [[Multimeters (Universeelmeters)]] - Measuring V, I, and R.
*   [[Reactance & Impedance]] - AC circuit analysis.

## Related
*   [[Voltage and Current Sources]] - Ideal vs Real sources.
*   [[Resistors]] - The passive components used.
