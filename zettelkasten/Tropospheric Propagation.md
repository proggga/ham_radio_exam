# Tropospheric Propagation

Weather conditions in the lower atmosphere (Troposphere, 0-10km) can extend [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]]/[[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|UHF]] range beyond the horizon.

## Modes
*   **Tropospheric Ducting**: Temperature inversions (warm air over cold air) form a "duct".
    *   Signals get trapped and travel hundreds or thousands of km like in a waveguide.
    *   Common in summer high-pressure systems.
*   **Troposcatter**: Scattering of signals off turbulence and irregularities in the air mass.
    *   Consistent but weak signals up to ~800km. Requires high power.
*   **Rain Scatter**: Microwave signals (GHz) reflect off heavy rain storms.
