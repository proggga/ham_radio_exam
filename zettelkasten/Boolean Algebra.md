# Boolean Algebra

Boolean algebra provides the rules for simplifying digital logic circuits.

## De Morgan's Laws
These laws allow converting between AND and OR logic using inversion.

1.  **NAND equivalency**: $\overline{A \cdot B} = \bar{A} + \bar{B}$
    *   A NAND gate is equivalent to an OR gate with inverted inputs.
2.  **NOR equivalency**: $\overline{A + B} = \bar{A} \cdot \bar{B}$
    *   A NOR gate is equivalent to an AND gate with inverted inputs.
