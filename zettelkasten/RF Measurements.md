# RF Measurements

This map covers the instruments used to test and maintain radio equipment.

## Transmitter Testing
*   **[[SWR Meter]]** - Checking antenna match.
*   **[[Dummy Load]]** - Safe non-radiating test load.

## Circuit Analysis
*   **[[Dip Meter]]** - Finding resonance of passive circuits.
*   **[[Frequency Counter]]** - Measuring exact frequency.

## Receiver Testing
*   **[[Signal Generator]]** - Injecting test signals.

## Related
*   **[[Multimeters (Universeelmeters)]]** - DC/AC Voltage and Resistance.
