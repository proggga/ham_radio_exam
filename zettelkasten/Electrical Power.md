# Electrical Power (Vermogen)

Power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or used.

## Definition
*   **Symbol**: $P$
*   **Unit**: Watt ($W$).
    *   $1 \text{ Watt} = 1 \text{ Joule per second} (J/s)$.

## Formulas
Derived from [[Voltage, Current, and Ohm's Law|Ohm's Law]]:

1.  **Fundamental**: $P = U \times I$
    *   (Voltage $\times$ Current)
2.  **Resistive Load (Current known)**: $P = I^2 \times R$
    *   Used to calculate heat loss in cables or resistors.
3.  **Resistive Load (Voltage known)**: $P = \frac{U^2}{R}$
    *   Used to calculate power in a dummy load or speaker.
