# Map: Transmission Lines

This map covers the connection between the transmitter and the antenna.

## Hardware
*   [[Transmission Line Types]] - Coaxial vs. Open Wire.
*   [[Transmission Line Loss]] - Attenuation factors.

## Physics & Math
*   [[Velocity Factor]] - Speed of light in a cable.
*   [[Impedance Transformation]] - Using lines as transformers ($\lambda/4$).

## Related
*   [[Matching and SWR]] - Measuring line performance.
*   [[Antenna Types]] - What connects to the line.
