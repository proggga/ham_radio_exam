# Special Transformers

## Autotransformer
Uses a single tapped winding. The secondary is part of the primary (or vice versa).
*   **Pros**: Smaller, lighter, cheaper.
*   **Cons**: **NO** galvanic isolation (Direct connection to mains). Dangerous for safety.
*   **Variac**: An adjustable autotransformer.

## Balun (Balanced-Unbalanced)
Connects balanced lines (e.g., dipole antenna) to unbalanced lines (e.g., coax).
*   **1:1 Balun**: Current balun (choke) to stop common-mode current.
*   **4:1 Balun**: Impedance transformer (e.g., $200 \Omega$ antenna to $50 \Omega$ coax).
