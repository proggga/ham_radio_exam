# Dummy Load (Kunstantenne)

A Dummy Load is a non-radiating resistive load used to test transmitters.

## Characteristics
*   **Impedance**: $50 \Omega$ pure resistance.
*   **Construction**: Must be **Non-Inductive**.
    *   **Good**: Carbon composition or special thick-film resistors.
    *   **Bad**: Wirewound resistors (they act as inductors at RF).
*   **Power Rating**: Must be capable of dissipating the transmitter's output power as heat. Oil-filled cans are common for high power.

## Purpose
*   Testing and tuning transmitters without radiating a signal.
*   Prevents interference (QRM) on the amateur bands.
*   Protecting the transmitter from high SWR during testing.
