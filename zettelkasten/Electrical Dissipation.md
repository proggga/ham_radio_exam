# Electrical Dissipation

Dissipation is the conversion of electrical power into heat as current flows through a resistance.

## Mechanism
*   Electrons collide with atoms in the conductive material, transferring kinetic energy which manifests as heat.
*   **Formula**: $P = I^2 \times R$

## Component Ratings
Every component (Resistors, Transistors) has a **Power Rating** (e.g., 1/4 Watt, 100 Watt).
*   **Requirement**: $P_{dissipated} < P_{rated}$.
*   **Failure**: If the dissipated power exceeds the rating, the component will overheat, burn, or release "magic smoke".
