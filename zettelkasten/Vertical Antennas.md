# Vertical Antennas

Vertical antennas are popular for DX (long distance) due to their low angle of radiation.

## Ground Plane (GP)
A Quarter-wave ($\lambda/4$) vertical element.
*   **Radials**: Requires a ground plane (artificial ground) made of wires (radials).
*   **[[Impedance (Impedantie)|Impedance]]**:
    *   Horizontal radials: $\approx 36 \Omega$.
    *   Drooping radials ($45^\circ$): $\approx 50 \Omega$ (Good match for coax).

## 5/8 Wave Vertical
*   **Length**: $\approx 5/8 \lambda$ (physically longer than 1/4 wave).
*   **Gain**: **Higher gain** ($\approx 3 \text{ dB}$) than a 1/4 wave vertical because it compresses the radiation pattern closer to the horizon.
*   **Matching**: Not naturally resonant at $50 \Omega$ (has capacitive reactance). Requires a **loading coil** at the base to match impedance.
*   **Use**: Very popular for mobile [[VHFUHF Bands (6m, 2m, 70cm)|VHF]]/UHF work.

## Characteristics
*   **Radiation Pattern**: Omni-directional (radiates equally in all horizontal directions).
*   **Take-off Angle**: Low angle, good for reaching the ionosphere for long hops.
*   **[[AC Signals & Noise|Noise]]**: Susceptible to man-made noise (QRM) which is often vertically polarized.
