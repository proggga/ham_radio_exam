# Vertical Antennas

Vertical antennas are popular for DX (long distance) due to their low angle of radiation.

## Ground Plane (GP)
A Quarter-wave ($\lambda/4$) vertical element.
*   **Radials**: Requires a ground plane (artificial ground) made of wires (radials).
*   **Impedance**:
    *   Horizontal radials: $\approx 36 \Omega$.
    *   Drooping radials ($45^\circ$): $\approx 50 \Omega$ (Good match for coax).

## Characteristics
*   **Radiation Pattern**: Omni-directional (radiates equally in all horizontal directions).
*   **Take-off Angle**: Low angle, good for reaching the ionosphere for long hops.
*   **Noise**: Susceptible to man-made noise (QRM) which is often vertically polarized.
