# Resistor Types

## Fixed Resistors
Value is constant and determined by the manufacturer.
*   **Carbon Film**: Common, general purpose, low cost.
*   **Metal Film**: Higher precision, lower noise, better stability.
*   **Wirewound**: High power handling, but has inductance (not suitable for [[Propagation Basics|HF]]).

## Variable Resistors
Value can be adjusted mechanically.
*   **Potentiometer**: Three terminals acting as a voltage divider. Used for volume controls.
*   **Rheostat**: Two terminals (variable resistance). Used to limit current.

## Thermistors
Temperature-dependent resistors.
*   **NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient)**: Resistance **decreases** as temperature rises.
    *   *Use*: Temperature sensing, inrush current limiting.
*   **PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient)**: Resistance **increases** as temperature rises.
    *   *Use*: Over-current protection (resettable fuses).
