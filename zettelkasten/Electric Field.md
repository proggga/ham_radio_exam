# Electric Field (Elektrisch Veld)

An electric field is a physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles and exerts force on all other charged particles in the field.

## Characteristics
*   **Existence**: Appears between two points with a potential difference (voltage), such as the plates of a [[Capacitor Principles|Capacitor]].
*   **Force**: Exerts force on electric charges ($F = Q \times E$).

## Field Strength ($E$)
The intensity of the field.
*   **Formula**: $$E = \frac{U}{d}$$
    *   $U$ = Voltage (Volt)
    *   $d$ = Distance (meters)
*   **Unit**: Volts per meter ($V/m$).

## Shielding (Afscherming)
*   **Faraday Cage**: A conductive enclosure (copper, aluminum) blocks static electric fields.
*   Charges redistribute on the surface of the conductor, canceling the field inside.

## Related Notes
*   [[Electrical Charge (Coulomb)]] - The source of the field.
*   [[Capacitor Principles]] - A device that stores energy in an electric field.
*   [[Electromagnetic Waves]] - Oscillating E-fields are half of a radio wave.
