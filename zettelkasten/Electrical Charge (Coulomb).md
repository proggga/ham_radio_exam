# Electrical Charge

Electrical charge is a fundamental property of matter carried by protons and electrons.

## Charge in Atoms
*   **Protons:** Carry a positive charge (+).
*   **Electrons:** Carry a negative charge (-).
*   **Neutral Atom:** Has an equal number of protons and electrons, resulting in a net charge of 0.

## Unit: Coulomb (C)
The SI unit of charge is the **Coulomb (C)**.
*   **Elementary Charge ($e$):** The charge of a single electron is approximately $-1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$.
*   **1 Coulomb:** Represents the charge of approximately $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

## Relationship to Current
Charge is the basis for electric current.
*   **Current ($I$):** The flow of charge ($Q$) over time ($t$).
    $$I = \frac{Q}{t}$$
    (See [[Voltage, Current, and Ohm's Law]])
