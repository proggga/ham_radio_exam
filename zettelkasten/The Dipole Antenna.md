# The Dipole Antenna

The dipole is the fundamental antenna against which others are often compared.

## Construction
*   **Length**: Approximately half a wavelength ($\lambda/2$).
    *   Formula (meters): $L = \frac{142.5}{f_{MHz}}$ (accounts for velocity factor).
*   **Feedpoint**: Fed in the center.
    *   **Voltage**: Low at center, High at ends.
    *   **Current**: High at center, Low at ends.

## Characteristics
*   **Impedance**: $\approx 73 \Omega$ in free space. Lowers as it gets closer to the ground.
*   **Radiation Pattern**: Figure-8 (Broadside to the wire). Nulls off the ends.
*   **Polarization**: Horizontal (if hung horizontally).

## Variants
*   **Inverted V**: Center supported high, ends drooping.
    *   Omni-directional, lower impedance (~$50 \Omega$).
*   **Folded Dipole**: Folded back on itself.
    *   Higher impedance (~$300 \Omega$).
    *   Wider bandwidth.
*   **Trap Dipole**: Uses LC traps to electrically shorten the antenna for multiple bands.
